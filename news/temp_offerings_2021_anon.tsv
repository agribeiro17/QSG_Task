2021-01-05 22:52:45	NEBX	Alibaba To Raise Above $5B Via Dollar Bonds This Month: Reuters	Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: NEBX ) is planning to raise at least $5 billion through a sale of U.S.-dollar-denominated bonds this month, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. What Happened: The Jack Ma co-founded company could raise as much as $8 billion from the offering if the investor response is favorable, as per the newswire, and funds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Why It Matters: The offering would be a gauge of investor interest in Alibaba, which is facing intense regulatory scrutiny in China following the comments of Ma at an event in Shanghai late last year that were critical of the regulations in the country, Reuters noted. Alibaba sister company Ant Group&rsquo;s $37 billion planned initial public offering was said to be personally scuttled by China&rsquo;s President Xi Jinping. Ma has been absent from public view since the GIP was quashed. The e-commerce giant received its latest jolt from outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on Tuesday banning transactions with its payments app Alipay.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as &quot;may,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; &quot;could,&quot; &quot;predict,&quot; &quot;potential,&quot; &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;will likely result,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;continue,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; &quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;seek,&quot; &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;intend,&quot; &quot;plan,&quot; &quot;project,&quot; &quot;projection,&quot; &quot;forecast,&quot; &quot;goal,&quot; &quot;target,&quot; &quot;would,&quot; &quot;aim&quot; and &quot;outlook,&quot; or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry and management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that such expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. For information about other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements contained in this release, please refer to the Company's public reports filed with the SEC. Further, given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations: the demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income; if the economy is unable to fully reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income; collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase; our allowance for loan losses may increase if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which will adversely affect our net income; the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; as the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board's target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income; our cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and FDIC premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this earnings release, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether because of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict their occurrence. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each risk and uncertainty on our business or the extent to which any risk or uncertainty, or combination of risks and uncertainties, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

About TAVO &trade; OncoSec's gene therapy technology combines TAVO&trade; (tavokinogene telseplasmid), a TWU plasmid-based interleukin-12 (&quot;IL-12&quot;), with an intra-tumoral electroporation gene delivery platform to achieve endogenous IL-12 production in the tumor microenvironment that enables the immune system to target and attack tumors throughout the body. TAVO has demonstrated a local and systemic anti-tumor response in several clinical trials, including the pivotal Phase 2b trial KEYNOTE-695 for metastatic melanoma and the KEYNOTE-890 Phase 2 trial in triple negative breast cancer (&quot;TNBC&quot;). TAVO has received both Orphan Drug and Fast-Track Designation by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. About OncoSec Medical Incorporated OncoSec Medical Incorporated (the &quot;Company,&quot; &quot;OncoSec,&quot; &quot;we&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) is a late-stage biotechnology company focused on developing cytokine-based intratumoral immunotherapies to stimulate the body's immune system to target and attack cancer. OncoSec's lead immunotherapy investigational product candidate &ndash; TAVO (tavokinogene telseplasmid) &ndash; enables the intratumoral delivery of TWU-based interleukin-12 (&quot;IL-12&quot;), a naturally occurring protein with immune-stimulating functions. The technology, which employs electroporation, is designed to produce a controlled, localized expression of IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment, enabling the immune system to target and attack tumors throughout the body. OncoSec has built a deep and diverse clinical pipeline utilizing TAVO as a potential treatment for multiple cancer indications either as a monotherapy or in combination with leading checkpoint inhibitors; with the latter potentially enabling OncoSec to address a great unmet medical need in oncology: anti-PD-1 non-responders. Results from recently completed clinical studies of TAVO have demonstrated a local immune response, and subsequently, a systemic effect as either a monotherapy or combination treatment approach along with an acceptable safety profile, warranting further development. In addition to TAVO, OncoSec is identifying and developing new TWU-encoded therapeutic candidates and tumor indications for use with its new Visceral Lesion Applicator, to target deep visceral lesions, such as liver, lung or pancreatic lesions.

The Private Placement will be cancelled if the conditions are not fulfilled, and may be cancelled by the Company in its sole discretion for any other reason. In order to facilitate timely delivery of already listed shares, delivery of the Offer Shares allocated in the Private Placement will be settled by delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company borrowed from Hemen. The shares delivered to investors in the Private Placement (other than Hemen) will thus be tradable on the Oslo Stock Exchange immediately after allocation. The Managers will settle the share loan from Hemen with the new shares issued in the Private Placement.

The contemplated Private Placement involves the setting aside of the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for new shares. The Board has considered the Private Placement in light of the rules of equal treatment set out in the Euronext Oslo Continuing Obligations and the Oslo Stock Exchange's guidelines on the rules on equal treatment. The Board is of the opinion that the Private Placement will allow for the Company to raise capital more quickly and, at a lower discount compared to a rights issue. Furthermore, the Board is of the opinion that, in the current market, a private placement has a larger possibility of success compared to a rights issue. On this basis, the Board has concluded that the Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements. The Company may, subject to completion of the Private Placement, and certain other conditions, resolve to carry out a subsequent offering of new shares which, subject to applicable securities law, will be directed towards existing shareholders in the Company as of 20 January 2021 (as registered in the VPS two trading days thereafter), who (i) were not included in the pre-sounding phase of the Private Placement, (ii) were not allocated Offer Shares in the Private Placement, and (iii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or, would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus, filing, registration or similar action.

2021-02-26 09:15:47	JPGP	Magyar Bancorp Reports Adoption Of Plan Of Conversion, Reorganization Via Second-Step Stock Offering, No Size Disclosed	Magyar Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: JPGP ) (the &quot;Company&quot;), parent company of Magyar Bank, announced today that its Board of Directors, together with the Board of Directors of Magyar Bancorp, MHC (the &quot;MHC&quot;), has adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the &quot;Plan of Conversion&quot;). Pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, the Company will reorganize into a fully public stock holding company structure and as part of the conversion will conduct a second-step stock offering of new shares of common stock. As part of the conversion, the MHC will merge into the Company and will cease to exist, and shares of the Company's common stock held by persons other than the MHC will be exchanged for new shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to an exchange ratio generally intended to preserve the percentage ownership interests of such persons in the Company upon consummation of the conversion. Shares of Company common stock owned by the MHC will be canceled and the amount of the MHC's ownership interest in the Company will be sold through the second-step stock offering. In the stock offering, depositors of Magyar Bank with qualifying deposits as of December 31, 2019 will have first priority to purchase the new shares of common stock. The conversion and offering will have no impact on depositors, borrowers or other customers of Magyar Bank. The transactions contemplated by the Plan of Conversion are subject to approval by the Company's stockholders (including approval by a majority of the shares held by persons other than the MHC), the depositors of Magyar Bank, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. A prospectus or proxy statement/prospectus, as applicable, and other materials containing detailed information relating to the Plan of Conversion, details of the offering, and business and financial information about the Company will be sent to stockholders of the Company and depositors of Magyar Bank following receipt of regulatory approval.
2021-03-01 07:02:12	JQVI	Twitter, Inc. Announces $1.25B Convertible Notes Offering In A Private Placement	SAN FRANCISCO, March 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: JQVI ) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the &quot;notes&quot;) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Act&quot;). Twitter also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, to cover over-allotments, if any. The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of Twitter, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Twitter's common stock, or a combination thereof, at Twitter's election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Twitter expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates or other financial institutions (the &quot;hedge counterparties&quot;). The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset the cash payments Twitter is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes in the event that the market price of the common stock is greater than the strike price of those convertible note hedge transactions. Twitter also expects to enter into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. The warrant transactions would separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of common stock exceeds the strike price of any warrant transactions, unless Twitter elects, subject to certain conditions set forth in the related warrant confirmations, to settle the warrant transactions in cash. If the initial purchasers exercise their over-allotment option to purchase additional notes, Twitter intends to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and additional warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Twitter expects that in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties or their respective affiliates may purchase shares of the common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Twitter's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Twitter expects that the hedge counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivative transactions with respect to the common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of the common stock or other securities of Twitter in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes or in connection with any repurchase of notes by Twitter). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. Twitter expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described above (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to Twitter from the warrant transactions described above), and the remaining proceeds to pay any amounts due upon conversion or at maturity of its 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions. The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.

The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at Beyond Meat&rsquo;s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 20, 2024 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the pricing of the offering. Beyond Meat intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. Beyond Meat intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and working capital. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Beyond Meat intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions as described below. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Beyond Meat expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (in this capacity, the &ldquo;option counterparties&rdquo;). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or, at Beyond Meat&rsquo;s election (subject to certain conditions), offset any cash payments Beyond Meat is required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Beyond Meat expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock and/or purchasing or selling Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock or other securities issued by Beyond Meat in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, which are expected to occur during the 20 trading day period beginning on the 21st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes, or following any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the notes, in each case if Beyond Meat exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder&rsquo;s ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock and value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon conversion of such notes. In addition, if any such capped call transaction fails to become effective, whether or not this offering of the notes is completed, the option counterparty party thereto may unwind its hedge positions with respect to Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock, which could adversely affect the value of Beyond Meat&rsquo;s common stock and, if the notes have been issued, the value of the notes. The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.

2021-03-15 17:12:32	BIZQ	Centennial Resource Development Announces Proposed Exchangeable Senior Notes Offering	Centennial Resource Development, Inc. Announces Proposed Exchangeable Senior Notes Offering DENVER, March 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centennial Resource Development, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIZQ ) (the &quot;Company&quot; or &quot;Centennial&quot;) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2028 (the &quot;notes&quot;) of its wholly owned operating subsidiary, Centennial Resource Production, LLC (&quot;CRP&quot;), in a public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis, by Centennial and CRP's subsidiaries that currently guarantee CRP's outstanding senior notes. CRP expects to grant the underwriters of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $22,500,000 principal amount of notes, solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of CRP, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on April 1, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or exchanged. Noteholders will have the right to exchange their notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. CRP will settle exchanges by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of Centennial's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &quot;common stock&quot;), or a combination of cash and shares of Centennial's common stock, at CRP's election. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at CRP's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after April 7, 2025 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Centennial's common stock exceeds 130% of the exchange price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The interest rate, initial exchange rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the pricing of the offering. CRP intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. CRP intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem, at par, all of its outstanding 8.00% second lien senior secured notes due 2025 and to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then CRP intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions as described below, as well as to repay additional outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. In connection with the pricing of the notes, CRP and Centennial expect to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the underwriters and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the &quot;option counterparties&quot;). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Centennial's common stock initially underlying the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Centennial's common stock upon exchange of the notes and/or at CRP's election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments CRP is required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of exchanged notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional notes, CRP and Centennial expect to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Centennial's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Centennial's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Centennial's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Centennial's common stock or other securities issued by the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions or following any repurchase, redemption or early exchange of the notes, in each case if we exercise our option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Centennial's common stock or the notes, which could affect a noteholder's ability to exchange the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to an exchange of the notes, it could affect the number of shares, if any, and value of the consideration that a noteholder will receive upon exchange of the notes. In addition, if any such capped call transaction fails to become effective, whether or not the offering of the notes is completed, the option counterparty party thereto may unwind its hedge positions with respect to Centennial's common stock, which could adversely affect the value of Centennial's common stock and, if the notes have been issued, the value of the notes. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Jefferies LLC are acting as book-running managers for the offering. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;).

2021-03-16 14:30:54	PTPA	CleanSpark Stock Trades Lower After Offering: Technical Levels To Watch	CleanSpark Inc. (NASDAQ: PTPA ) shares were losing ground in Tuesday&rsquo;s session after the company announced a public offering of 9 million shares at $22 each. CleanSpark Short-Term Technical Analysis: The 5-minute chart above shows the stock took a large tumble following the offering news announced Monday. The offering price of $22 is an area that may provide short-term support to technical traders. The stock previously struggled to cross above the $32 mark. This is an area that may be a short-term resistance in the future. The price is trading below the 200-day moving average (blue), providing a bearish short-term sentiment. This indicator could be a potential resistance level in the future. The stock is holding the volume-weighted average price (pink). The price staying above this indicator helps the stock become more bullish in the short term. The price crossing below the VWAP may bring about more bearish sentiment in the short term. CleanSpark Daily Chart Analysis: Looking at the daily chart shows what technical traders may call a bullish flag pattern. The pattern comes after a bullish run and occurs when the stock consolidates for a while before the stock moves again. Although the pattern has the word &ldquo;bullish&rdquo; in the name, technical analysis is never always correct. Traders wanting to trade the stock should draw their own lines. The bottom of the channel may hold as support as it has in the past. The top of the channel may hold as resistance as it has in the past. Bears would like to see a break of support and this could possibly mean the stock moves down further. Bulls would like to see a break of resistance that could move the price up further. PTPA Price Action: The stock is trading with a market cap of $705 million and a public float of 21.35 million shares. The stock was down 24.71% at $22.09 at last check.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: Certain of our products are used by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment. Unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these and their financial cost may damage public perception of the safety, utility, or efficacy of these vaccines and therapies or other modes of treatment and may harm our customers' ability to conduct their business. Such events may negatively impact our revenue and have an adverse effect on our performance. We compete with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantially larger than we are and potentially capable of developing new approaches that could make our products, services and technology obsolete. We depend on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue. If we cannot maintain our current relationships with customers, fail to sustain recurring sources of revenue with our existing customers, or if we fail to enter into new relationships, our future operating results will be adversely affected. We rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our raw materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.

2021-04-12 16:58:55	ZY	NiSource To Sell 7.5M Equity Units	NiSource Inc. (NYSE: ZY ) (&quot;NiSource&quot;) announced today its intention to offer to sell, subject to market and other conditions, 7,500,000 Equity Units, each with a stated amount of $100. Each Equity Unit will initially be in the form of a Corporate Unit consisting of a contract to purchase shares of NiSource common stock (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;) in the future and a 1/10th, or 10%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the &quot;Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock&quot;). NiSource expects to grant the underwriters an option to purchase 1,125,000 additional Corporate Units to cover over-allotments. In addition, NiSource has updated its financing strategy for 2021-2024: The offering is expected to satisfy all anticipated discrete equity needs of NiSource through 2024 (except for issuances under its existing programmatic ATM program) and eliminates the need for the discrete (block) equity issuance NiSource originally planned for calendar years 2022 or 2023. Further Details of Equity Units Offering: Pursuant to the offering, the Common Stock is expected to be delivered upon settlement of the purchase contracts on December 1, 2023 (subject to early settlement in certain circumstances). NiSource expects to pay, quarterly in arrears, contract adjustment payments on the stated amount of each Equity Unit at a rate to be determined in connection with the offering. NiSource may pay such contract adjustment payments in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at its election. NiSource may also, in its discretion, defer contract adjustment payments. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is expected to be remarketed either as part of an optional remarketing elected by us or during a final remarketing period. Following any successful remarketing, dividends may become payable on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and/or the minimum conversion rate of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be increased. The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock initially will not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will not accrete. Each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted only after being separated from the Corporate Units and, prior to December 1, 2023, only upon the occurrence of certain fundamental change events (unless a remarketing failure as described below has previously occurred). Each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, unless previously converted, will automatically convert on the mandatory conversion date (which is expected to be on or about March 1, 2024) into a variable number of shares of Common Stock as determined in the offering. However, if no successful remarketing of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has previously occurred, effective as of December 1, 2023, the conversion rate will be zero, no shares of Common Stock will be delivered upon automatic conversion and each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be automatically transferred to NiSource on the mandatory conversion date without any payment of cash or shares of the Common Stock thereon. In the event of such a remarketing failure, any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock held as part of Corporate Units will be automatically delivered to NiSource on December 1, 2023 in full satisfaction of the relevant holder's obligation under the related purchase contracts. NiSource intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for renewable generation investments and general corporate purposes, including additions to working capital and repayment of existing indebtedness. The offering is consistent with NiSource meeting its near and long-term financial plan. The Equity Unit structure of this offering allows NiSource to retain share price upside while aligning the expected proceeds with its renewable investment needs. Concurrently, NiSource expects to have a renewable capital expenditure requirement of approximately $2.0 billion. NiSource intends to apply to list the Corporate Units on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;NIMC.&quot; Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for this offering.

If consummated, Bally's anticipates this offering would provide net proceeds in an amount comparable to the Unit offering. The terms of such possible other transaction have not been finalized. There is no assurance that Bally's will consummate any such transaction or, if so, or the timing or terms currently contemplated. Bally's previously announced offering of $600 million of its common stock, including the underwriters option for a period of 30 days to purchase up to an additional 15% of common stock, is expected to proceed as planned. In addition, another strategic investor is expected to make a $50 million investment to purchase warrants exerciseable for shares Bally's common stock at the same price per share as the price to the public in the common stock offering. It is possible that Bally's will consider the issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities in the future.

If the Combination is not consummated, Bally's expects to apply the net proceeds from the common stock offering and the strategic investments for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of debt, repurchases of its common stock, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments.

2021-05-05 09:33:02	WXYT	Rookie Traders Get Crushed By Cocrystal Pharma Stock	The trading in biotechnology company Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: WXYT ) is a good example of how inexperienced traders can lose a lot of money. What Happened: Cocrystal closed Tuesday at $2.14, a gain of over 70%. At one point during the day, shares reached $3.46, which was about 270% higher than the previous close. This move was driven by news that the company was going to offer 26 million new shares to the public priced at $1.54 a share. It appears as though all the investors who bought WXYT and didn&rsquo;t sell are going to lose money. Wednesday morning, shares are trading around $1.50. See Also: Cocrystal Pharma Shares Plunge On $40M Equity Raise At 28% Discount Why It's Important: Traders who think a company offering new shares is a good thing are usually wrong, as offering shares is a typically bearish sign for a company. When a company issues new shares, they typically do so because the insiders and their bankers think shares are overvalued. They sell because they're taking advantage of what they perceive to be a premium in the share price. If the company thinks shares are a good sell at $1.54, why would an investor who doesn&rsquo;t know much about the company think that they're worth more? Rookie traders could save money if they learn this valuable lesson.

2021-05-13 09:32:31	KRN	KRN Apartments Announces Termination Of Public Offering Of Common Stock	KRN Apartments Corp. (NYSE: KRN ) (the &quot;Company&quot;), today announced it has terminated the contemplated underwritten public offering of its common stock previously announced on May 10, 2021.

In light of the termination of the offering, the Company anticipates that it will fund the purchase price from its available cash, its $15 million credit facility and proceeds from property sales. As of April 30, 2021, the Company's liquidity was approximately $45.49 million, comprising $21.98 million of cash and cash equivalents, $8.51 million of restricted cash, and up to $15.0 million available under its credit facility. The offering was being made pursuant to an effective shelf-registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019.

The stock crossed above the 50-day moving average (green) Thursday, and trades above the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating sentiment in the stock looks to be turning bullish. The price may find support near each of these moving averages in the future. Key ZUS Levels To Watch The stock looks to be nearing the end of a pennant pattern.

In the clinical hold letter, the FDA stated it needs a full study report from the ongoing NHP study and Larimar may not initiate additional clinical trials until the company has submitted the report and received notification from the agency that additional clinical trials may commence. &quot;While the notification of a formal clinical hold is disappointing, it does not change our previously stated clinical development strategy for CTI-1601,&quot; said Carole Ben-Maimon, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Larimar. &quot;Patient safety is our top priority, and we will continue with our plan to complete the NHP toxicology study, assess the data, and discuss that data with FDA to obtain their consent prior to initiating our Jive and pediatric MAD trials. Based on all of the information we have regarding CTI-1601's safety profile to date, we continue to believe there is a path forward toward the initiation of our Jive and pediatric MAD trials. However, due to the additional regulatory requirements that come with responding to a formal clinical hold, we believe there is a possibility that the initiation of these trials may be delayed into 2022. Regarding the termination of the previously announced private placement financing, as of March 31, 2021, we have $81.4 million in cash and investments, which provides cash runway through the first half of 2022.&quot; The safety of CTI-1601 was previously evaluated in Phase 1 single- and multiple-ascending dose clinical trials. Recently announced data from these trials indicate that repeated subcutaneous injections of CTI-1601 were generally well tolerated at doses up to 100 mg administered daily for 13 days. No serious adverse events, important medical events, or treatment-related severe adverse events were reported in the trial and the number and severity of adverse events did not increase with increasing exposure to CTI-1601. The most common adverse events were mild and moderate injection site reactions. Data from the MAD trial also showed that daily subcutaneous injections of CTI-1601 at doses of 50 mg or 100 mg resulted in frataxin levels in peripheral tissues (buccal cells) that were at or in excess of those that would be expected in phenotypically normal heterozygous carriers.

2021-06-01 08:13:49	ZUS	ZUS Raises $230.5M Through Private Placement To Hedge Fund Mudrick: What Investors Need To Know	ZUS Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ZUS ) shares more than doubled in the last week, and capitalizing on the appreciation, the theatre chain announced a private placement of its common stock. What Happened: ZUS has issued 8.5 million shares of its common stock, valued at $230.5 million, to hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management, an 8-K filing by the company revealed Tuesday. The per-share value of the offering works out to $27.12. This is at a premium to the $26.12 at which ZUS shares closed on Friday. Over the week ended May 28, the stock ran up over 116%. ZUS said it intends to use the net proceeds to pursue value-creating acquisitions of theater assets and leases, as well as enhancing the consumer appeal of its theaters. The company is also planning to use the net proceeds for exploring deleveraging options. The purchase agreement requires the shares to be &quot;freely-tradeable.&quot; Simultaneously, ZUS filed a supplement to a prospectus filed on April 27 regarding the sale from time to time by the selling stockholder, identified as Mudrick, to sell up to 8.5 million shares of its Class A common stock. Related Link: ZUS Shares Pop On Upgrade: Why Analyst Sees Potential For Sharp Recovery Why It's Important: After a dismal 2020 on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, ZUS is slowly and steadily picking up the pieces. The company is considered a major beneficiary of economic reopening. ZUS could capitalize on an anticipated rebound in domestic box office receipts, new studio agreements and its improving balance sheet, B Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold said in a recent note. The additional cash infusion should come in handy to pursue growth vigorously when the box office returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. &quot;Given that ZUS is raising hundreds of millions of dollars, this is an extremely positive result for our shareholders. It was achieved through the issuance of only 8.5 million shares, representing less than 1.7% of our issued share capital and only a small portion of our typical daily trading volume,&quot; ZUS CEO and President Adam Aron said in a statement. ZUS Price Action: In premarket trading Tuesday, ZUS shares were rallying 17.53% to $30.70. Related Link: Why This Analyst Says ZUS Entertainment Stock Is 'Dramatically Overvalued'

Riley And Citigroup Relating To Shares Of Class A Common Stock Offered By Prospectus Supplement; Says May Offer And Sell From Time To Time Up To Aggregate Of 11.55M Shares Of Class A Common Stock	We have entered into an equity distribution agreement (the &ldquo;Distribution Agreement&rdquo;) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as our sales agents, relating to the shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 (the &ldquo;Class A common stock&rdquo;), offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. In accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we may, through our sales agents, offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of 11,550,000 shares of our Class A common stock. The sales agents may act as agents on our behalf or purchase shares of our Class A common stock as principal. Sales, if any, of our Class A common stock, under this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus may be made in sales deemed to be &ldquo;at the market offerings&rdquo; as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;), including by sales made directly on or through the New York Stock Exchange (&ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;) or another market for our Class A common stock, sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or otherwise, in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices, or as otherwise agreed with the applicable sales agents. We will submit orders to only one sales agents relating to the sale of shares of our Class A common stock on any given day. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement, the sales agents will use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell on our behalf all of the designated shares. We may instruct the sales agents not to sell any shares of Class A common stock if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by us in any such instruction. We also may sell shares of our Class A common stock to one or more of the sales agents, as principal for their own accounts, at a price per share agreed upon at the time of sale. If we sell shares to one or more sales agents, as principal, we will enter into a separate terms agreement with such sales agent or agents, and we will describe the agreement in a separate prospectus supplement or pricing supplement. We will pay the sales agents a commission of up to 2.5% of the gross sales price per share sold through them as our agent under the Distribution Agreement. In connection with the sale of our shares of Class A common shares on our behalf, the sales agents will be deemed to be &ldquo;underwriters&rdquo; within the meaning of the Securities Act, and the compensation paid to the sales agents will be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts. Our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol &ldquo;ZUS.&rdquo; The market prices and trading volume of our shares of Class A common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Class A common stock to incur substantial losses. During 2021 to date, the market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $1.91 per share on January 5, 2021 to an intra-day high on the NYSE of $72.62 on June 2, 2021, and the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on June 2, 2021, was $62.55 per share. During 2021 to date, according to the New York Stock Exchange, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 23,598,228 to 1,253,253,550 shares. These extreme fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. While the market price of our Class A common stock may respond to developments regarding our liquidity, operating performance and prospects, developments regarding COVID-19 and vaccination progress, and developments regarding our industry, we believe that recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. Within the last seven business days, the market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $12.18 on May 24, 2021 to an intra-day high of $72.62 on June 2, 2021, and we have made no disclosure regarding a change to our underlying business during that period, other than with respect to an additional financing. Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment. See &ldquo;Risk Factors&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Risks Related to This Offering.&rdquo; Settlement of any sales of our Class A common stock will occur on the second business day following the date on which such sales were made (or such earlier day as is industry practice for regular-way trading). There is no arrangement for funds to be received in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement. Sales of our Class A common stock as contemplated in this prospectus supplement will be settled through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company or by such other means as we and the sales agents may agree.

2021-06-03 09:48:50	ZUS	ZUS Entertainment Announces Another Stock Offering, Warns Investors They Could Lose 'All Or A Substantial Portion' Of Their Money	ZUS Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: ZUS ) stock gave up big premarket gains and was plunging Thursday after the company announced a new stock offering and warned its investors about the risks involved in owning shares. What Happened: For the second time in three days, ZUS announced a stock offering. The at-the-market offering of up to 11.5 million shares comes just two days after ZUS issued 8.5 million shares to Mudrick Capital. Mudrick immediately cashed out of the position for a significant profit during ZUS&rsquo;s extremely volatile rally this week. Related Link: 8 Stocks With The Highest Short Percent Of Float Right Now Why It&rsquo;s Important: ZUS used extremely strong language in its 8-K filing, warning investors that buying into the frenzy could result in major losses. &ldquo;We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment,&rdquo; the company said in the filing. ZUS&rsquo;s outstanding share count is already up more than 333% since the beginning of 2020 as the company has been aggressively dumping stock to raise money to stave off bankruptcy. In 2020, ZUS reported a net loss of $4.59 billion. In the first quarter of 2021, the company added another $566.9 million to its loss tally. Even prior to the pandemic, ZUS was hemorrhaging cash, reporting a $149.1-million net loss in 2019. As the company itself acknowledged in Thursday&rsquo;s filing, there is an extreme disconnect between ZUS&rsquo;s struggling business and its stock price. ZUS&rsquo;s market cap is nearly $30 billion, suggesting the company is somehow worth more than 60 times what it was back in 2014. &ldquo;Millions of people are playing musical chairs, and there&rsquo;s only a handful of seats,&rdquo; Michael Batnick, director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. &ldquo;When the music stops, prices will come crashing down.&rdquo; ZUS Price Action: ZUS shares were down 21.43% at $50.68 at last check Thursday. Benzinga&rsquo;s Take: It&rsquo;s difficult to make a long-term bullish case for a stock when the company itself is essentially telling investors they&rsquo;d be nuts to buy at its current price. However, in the short-term, ZUS may continue to trade higher on frenzied market speculation, and traders who time the moves correctly could cash out with some major gains. Photo courtesy of ZUS.

(NYSE: WBOQ ) has filed for a global equity offering. What Happened: XPeng is offering 85 million Class A ordinary shares as part of global offering, the Chinese EV maker said in an amended F-1 filing with the SEC Thursday. The offering, according to the company, will consist of an international offering of 80.75 million Class A shares and a Hong Kong offering of 4.25 million Class A shares. The company said the Hong Kong offering will be priced at 161.46 Hong Kong dollars per share, with the pricing calculated based on the $41.61 per ADS price at which the company's ADSs listed on the NYSE closed Wednesday. Each ADSs represent two Class A shares, and an exchange rate of 7.7604 Hong Kong dollars per $1 was used, the company said. Related Link: Why This Nio, Xpeng Analyst Is Bullish After Q1 EV Delivery Updates XPeng said it will determine the offer price for both the international offering and the Hong Kong public offering based on the closing price of the ADSs on the last trading day before the pricing of the global offering, which is expected to be on or about June 30. The maximum offer price for the Hong Kong public offering is 180 Hong Kong dollars per share, the company added. XPeng said it expects to receive net proceeds of about $1.94 billion from the global offering, and $2.23 billion if underwriters exercise their option to cover overallotment. The company expects to use 45% of the net proceeds for expansion of production portfolio and development of more advanced technology, 35% to accelerate its business, 10% to enhance production capability and the remaining 10% for general corporate purposes. Why It's Important: XPeng is operating in a capital-intensive industry where multiple players are vying for a piece of cake in a lucrative market. Apart from the P7 EV sedan and G3 SUVs and the variants the company currently sells, it recently announced a third model, the P5. The company has recently started monetizing its software following the introduction of its proprietary advanced driver assistance system called Xpilot 3.0 earlier this year. XPeng announced in April it has entered into a cooperation agreement with the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei province to build an EV manufacturing base in the city. The additional finances the company is raising will come in handy for improving its positioning in the industry, which is facing intensifying competition. At last check, XPeng shares were trading down 2.12% Thursday at $40.69. Related Link: Nio Vs. XPeng: How Chinese EV Duo's May Deliveries Stack Up Photo: courtesy of XPeng.
2021-06-24 11:58:29	QEJX	Why Penn National's Stock May Be A Gamble As It Heads Toward Support	Penn National Gaming Inc. (NASDAQ: QEJX ) shares are trading higher Thursday after the company announced a proposed private offering and updated its second-quarter revenue. Penn National expects revenue to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 billion, exceeding the estimate of $1.35 billion. Penn National was up 2% to $78.29 at last check. Below is a technical look at the stock's chart. See Also: Canada Passes Sports Betting Legislation: 3 Stocks That Could Benefit Penn National Daily Chart Analysis Shares recently cracked below the higher low trendline and are now testing a previously key support level. The stock is trading below both the 50-day moving average (green), and the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating sentiment in the stock has been bearish. Each of these moving averages may hold as an area of support. Key Penn National Levels To Watch The stock crossed below the higher trendline and could be ready to see a bounce at a key area near $75. The $75 level is an area on the chart where the stock once found resistance, but broke above and now may hold as support. The stock is currently testing to see if this level holds as support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been falling and sits below 50, meaning that the stock has more sellers in it than buyers. The RSI took a large dip recently and almost reached the oversold area where there are many more sellers than buyers. What&rsquo;s Next For Penn National? Bullish technical traders would like to see the stock bounce at the $75 level and start heading back up. The stock getting back above the higher low trendline is the most ideal move bulls could get. Bulls also would like to see the RSI cross above 50. Bearish technical traders would like to see the stock fail to hold the $75 level as support. If the stock can consolidate for a time below the $75 level, it may see a large downward push. Photo credit: Baishampayan Ghose, Flickr

2021-06-29 16:48:19	BBX	Bank of America Recommends Shareholders Reject 'Mini-Tender' Offer By Tutanota	Bank of America today announced that it recently learned of an unsolicited &quot;mini-tender&quot; offer made by Tutanota LLC (Tutanota) to Bank of America shareholders to purchase up to 1 million shares of Bank of America common stock at $47 per share. The offer price of $47 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of Bank of America's common stock exceeding $47 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless this condition is waived by Tutanota, Bank of America shareholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price. Tutanota can extend the offer for successive periods of 45 to 180 days, in which case payment would be delayed beyond the scheduled expiration date of Friday, July 16, 2021. Bank of America recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota's offer because the offer requires that the closing stock price for Bank of America common stock exceed the offer price, and the offer is subject to numerous additional conditions, including Tutanota obtaining financing for the offer. There is no guarantee the conditions of the offer will be satisfied. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time by providing notice in the manner described in the Tutanota offering documents prior to the expiration of the offer, which is currently scheduled for 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Friday, July 16, 2021, unless extended. Bank of America does not endorse Tutanota's unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not affiliated or associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer, or the offer documentation. Because Tutanota's mini-tender offer is for less than 5 percent of Bank of America's outstanding shares, it is not subject to many of the disclosure and procedural requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules that are designed to protect investors. Tutanota has made similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for stock of other public companies. The SEC has cautioned investors about mini-tender offers, providing guidance to investors at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm . Bank of America encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosures at www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm and the NASD Notice to Members 99-53 issued in July 1999 regarding guidance to members forwarding mini-tender offers to their customers, which can be found at https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/NoticeDocument/p004221.pdf . Shareholders should obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor, and exercise caution with respect to Tutanota's mini-tender offer. Bank of America requests that a copy of this news release be included with all distributions of materials relating to Tutanota's mini-tender offer related to Bank of America's common stock.

(NYSE: WMY ) shares traded lower Tuesday after the company announced a tender offer for its 11.5% senior secured notes due 2023 subject to refinancing conditions. The stock may also be falling with the sector as other cruise companies are falling. Carnival closed down 4% at $25.02. Below is a technical look at the chart. Carnival Corp. Daily Chart Analysis Shares have been trading in a sideways channel and are now testing support. This is the fourth time the stock is testing this support level. The stock is trading below the 50-day moving average (green), but above the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating the stock is likely in a period of consolidation. The 50-day moving average may hold as an area of resistance while the 200-day moving average may act as an area of support. Key Carnival Corp. Levels To Watch The stock is testing the $25 level as support for the fourth time, a sign a drop could be coming if the stock is unable to see a bounce soon. If the $25 level is unable to hold, the stock may drop to the $18 level before it finds support again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 32 and has been falling throughout the past couple of weeks. This means there are more sellers entering the stock than there are buyers. This is another sign the stock may be due for a drop soon. What&rsquo;s Next For Carnival Corp.? Bulls would like to see the stock bounce at support and start heading higher. Bulls would like to see the stock cross above the 50-day moving average. This would mean sentiment in the stock is turning bullish. Bearish traders would like to see the stock break below the $25 level. If the stock dropped below the $25 level it may drop to the $18 level. Bears would also like to see the stock fall into the oversold area on the RSI.

2021-07-29 12:17:34	RDBF	Apple Files For 4-Part Debt Offering: Why Would The Tech Giant With Over $34B In Its Coffer Need Additional Finances?	Close on the heels of reporting strong quarterly results , Apple Inc (NASDAQ: RDBF ), has filed for a debt offering. What Happened: In a preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the SEC Thursday, Apple said it is planning a four-part note offering. The senior unsecured notes are due to mature in 2028, 2031, 2051 and 2061, respectively. The company has left the terms of the offering unfilled, although it suggested interest on the notes are to be paid semi-annually in arrears, beginning in 2022. Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities and Barclays will serve as joint book-running managers for the offerings. Apple said in the filing it will use the net proceeds from the potential sale for funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repayment of debt. The company also suggested it may temporarily invest funds that are not immediately needed for these purposes in short-term investments. Related Link: How Apple Neutralized Any Short-Term Weakness The Market Was Anticipating Apple Storing Up For Fueling Growth? Apple's cash and cash equivalents at the end of the June quarter were at $34.05 billion, a decline from $38.02 at the end of the March quarter. Cupertino's highest cash balance was at the end of the June quarter of 2019, which boasted cash and cash equivalents of $50.53 billion. The cash balance began to taper when the company resumed dividend payments in 2012 after a gap of about 17 years. In the same year, the company also initiated a buyback program. Apple is operating in a capital-intensive industry, with huge investments made in exploratory projects and improving the technology of its current products. The funding needs are acute to keep its products and services ahead of the competition. For some time now, Apple is also toying with its self-driving Apple Car project . From the perspective of the cost of financing, debt funds are cheaper than equity financing. The time required to secure debt financing is less and the borrowing corporate may not be bound by more severe covenants. Apple may also have been swayed by the prevailing extremely low interest rates. The Federal Reserve has maintained the Fed funds futures rate at a very accommodative level of 0.25% ever since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most lending rates are benchmarked on this key rate. APPL Price Action: At last check Thursday, Apple shares were up 0.66% at $145.94.

2021-08-05 08:29:35	BTCO	Robinhood Files For 97.9M-Share Common Stock Offering: What Investors Need To Know	Shares of newly listed trading app Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ: BTCO ), which experienced considerable volatility earlier this week, were moving to the downside Thursday. Here's why. What Happened: Robinhood filed with the SEC a preliminary prospectus on Form S-1 for offering up to 97.876 million shares of its Class A common stock. These shares will be offered by selling shareholders following the automatic conversion of certain convertible notes held by selling stockholders in connection with the initial public offering. The convertible notes were issued by Robinhood in a prior private placement transaction prior to its GIP. The company clarified that it will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares through the offering. The selling shareholders may sell any or all of the securities offered, the company said. The selling stockholders, the brokerage said, are investors who have had no position, office, or other material relationship with it or any of its affiliates within the past three years. New Enterprise Associates will be allowed to offload maximum shares, representing about 10.4% stake. Following the offering, only Andreessen Horowitz, D1 Master Holdco I and Thrive Capital, among the selling shareholders, will hold over 1% stakes. Related Link: Robinhood App Review Why It's Important: Robinhood made a forgettable debut on the Nasdaq last Thursday. The shares opened for trading at the GIP price of $28 and moved in a $33.35-$38 range before ending lower at $34.82. Robinhood shares began picking up momentum Tuesday, as they settled above the GIP price at $46.80. On Wednesday, the stock experienced significant volatility and was halted for trading a few times. After moving in a $54.40-$85 range, the stock settled at $70.39 amid frenzied buying by retail investors. The news of the proposed stock sale is likely to exert downward pressure on the shares given the additional supply that will come online. BTCO Price Action: In premarket trading, the stock was down 7.96% at $64.79. Related Link: Robinhood's GIP Access Product Allows Retail Investors To Buy GIP Shares

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005839/en/ Fisker Inc. today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the &quot;notes&quot;) in a private offering only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Act&quot;). Fisker also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $90,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the notes. (Photo: Business Wire) The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Fisker, and interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2022. The notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The notes will be convertible under certain circumstances into cash, shares of Fisker's Class A common stock (the &ldquo;Common Stock&rdquo;), or a combination thereof, at Fisker's election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Fisker expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or affiliates thereof and/or other financial institutions (the &quot;option counterparties&quot;). The capped call transactions are expected to cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Common Stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Common Stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any potential cash payments that Fisker is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Fisker expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. In connection with establishing their initial hedge of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Common Stock and/or may purchase shares of Common Stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Common Stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Fisker expects that the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding certain derivative transactions with respect to the Common Stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of Common Stock or other securities of Fisker in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Common Stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. Fisker intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, one or more new or existing &ldquo;eligible green projects&rdquo; of Fisker, including PEAR program development, battery pack assembly and potential localization, the furtherance of new model development and technology development. Pending such allocation of net proceeds to eligible green projects, Fisker intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions described above and for working capital and general corporate purposes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Fisker intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful. The notes will be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, such registration requirements of the Act and other applicable securities laws.

2021-09-15 16:40:14	HTD	Why Did Callaway Stock Rally Today?	Callaway Golf Co (NYSE: HTD ) shares are trading higher Wednesday, possibly after the company announced the proposed public offering of three million shares of its common stock by PEP TG Investments LP. Callaway Golf was up 11.05% at $30.04 at last check Wednesday. Callaway Golf Daily Chart Analysis The stock looks to have bounced off support in what technical traders call a falling wedge pattern. The stock is falling and looks to be getting squeezed between the highs and the lows. A break of support or resistance could push the stock further in the same direction. The stock was rejected at the 50-day moving average (green) Wednesday and unable to cross above, but the stock crossed above the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating the stock is possibly seeing sentiment turn bullish. The 50-day moving average may act as resistance, the 200-day moving average may act as support in the future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) pushed higher and crossed above the middle line Wednesday, sitting at 55. The RSI shows there&rsquo;s now more buying pressure than selling pressure in the stock. See Also: PEP TG Investments To Sell 3M Shares In Callaway Golf What&rsquo;s Next For Callaway? Bullish traders are looking to see the stock move higher up toward pattern resistance. Bulls would then like to see a strong above-average volume move breaking out of the pattern. Bearish traders would like to see the stock fall lower and drop below the pattern support.

(NASDAQ: HTWG ) announced today that it has paid off in full at maturity the remaining $64.4 million in principal amount outstanding of its 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2021. In addition, the Company provided an update on the progress of its renewed &ldquo;at-the-market&rdquo; (ATM) equity offering program announced in mid-August, pursuant to which it has sold during the third quarter of 2021 to date an aggregate of approximately 9.4 million shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $43.0 million and resulting in net proceeds to Clovis Oncology of approximately $41.7 million after commissions and offering related expenses. This is in addition to the previously announced approximately $72.5 million in net proceeds raised by Clovis Oncology pursuant to its ATM equity offering program during the second quarter of 2021. &ldquo;These activities improve our balance sheet and complement our ongoing focus on cost control as we look forward to the potentially transformative events of 2022,&rdquo; said Patrick J. Mahaffy, President and CEO of Clovis Oncology. &ldquo;In 2022, we anticipate three Phase 3 data read-outs for Rubraca&reg;, which offer the potential to significantly expand the number of ovarian and prostate cancer patients eligible for Rubraca treatment in the US and Europe. In addition, we are enthusiastic about our ongoing Phase 1 LuMIERE study of FAP-2286 in advanced solid tumors, and expect the presentation of initial Phase 1 data at a medical meeting in 2022. Each of these supports our three key strategies: expand the Rubraca label to drive revenue growth, emerge as a leader in targeted radionuclide therapy, and achieve long-term financial stability.&rdquo; Three anticipated data readouts from Rubraca studies are anticipated in 2022: ATHENA monotherapy in first-line maintenance treatment ovarian cancer in Q1 2022, TRITON3 monotherapy in second-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Q2 2022, and ATHENA combination with Opdivo&reg; in first-line maintenance treatment ovarian cancer in 2H 2022. These data read-outs provide the potential to reach larger patient populations in earlier lines of therapy for ovarian and prostate cancers. The timing of each of these read-outs is contingent upon the occurrence of the protocol-specified progression-free survival events. FAP-2286 is Clovis Oncology&rsquo;s peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (PTRT) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and is the lead candidate in the Company&rsquo;s TRT development program. The Phase 1 portion of the LuMIERE study is evaluating the safety of the FAP-targeting investigational therapeutic agent and will identify the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of lutetium-177 labeled FAP-2286. FAP-2286 labeled with gallium-68 will be used as an investigational imaging agent to identify patients with FAP-positive tumors appropriate for treatment in LuMIERE. The first presentation of Phase 1 data from LuMIERE is expected at a medical meeting in 2022. Once the Phase 2 dose is determined, Phase 2 expansion cohorts are planned in multiple tumor types and expected to initiate in 2022. Sales of its common stock under the ATM equity offering program were made by Clovis Oncology pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Clovis Oncology.

(NASDAQ: FPZW ) shares are trading higher Tuesday after the company closed an $80 million private placement. The company closed its previously announced placement with institutional investors for the sale of 13,490,728 ordinary shares. Bit Digital is engaged in the bitcoin mining business.

With Bitcoin bouncing higher Tuesday, the stock is moving in sympathy. Bit Digital was up 27% at $9.68 at publication time. How Does Bitcoin Work? Bit Digital Daily Chart Analysis Shares look to be breaking out of what technical traders call a falling wedge pattern. A few months ago the stock was able to break out of one of these patterns and saw a large bullish push. The stock has been falling and has been getting pinched between narrowing highs and lows. The stock could continue to push higher and break out. The stock is trading below both the 50-day moving average (green)& and the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating sentiment has been bearish. The stock may find resistance near either of these moving averages in the future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) saw a jump the past few days and has pushed up to 49 on the indicator. This shows more buyers have moved into the stock causing the buying pressure to be relatively equal to the selling pressure. What&rsquo;s Next For Bit Digital? Bullish traders are looking to see the stock continue to break out of the wedge pattern and repeat what happened last time the stock broke out of a wedge pattern. Last time, the stock saw a large upwards push for the next few days before falling back into another wedge pattern. Bears would like to see the stock fall back down and start trading below the wedge pattern. If the stock falls below the pattern support in the pattern, it could be ready for a strong bearish move.

The Resale S-1 registers the potential resale of these Conversion Shares and was filed pursuant to a pre-existing contractual obligation under the purchase agreement for the Tranche I convertible notes. Separately, in connection with the GIP, the Tranche I note investors agreed to keep 50% of the Conversion Shares locked up until the 28th day after the Resale S-1 is declared effective (but no later than December 1, 2021). Robinhood is not itself selling any additional securities and the filing does not represent an underwritten secondary offering. Today, Robinhood filed a second amendment to the Resale S-1 and an acceleration request asking the SEC to declare the Resale S-1 effective at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on October 13, 2021. No sales can be made off the Resale S-1 until the SEC staff declares it effective. In addition, consistent with customary quarter-end trading limitations and pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the Tranche I convertible notes, Robinhood has determined that no sales may be made off the Resale S-1 at the time of its effectiveness. Robinhood will publicly announce when sales may be made off the Resale S-1. Robinhood&rsquo;s Resale S-1 suspension notice does not prevent Tranche I note investors from selling unlocked Conversion Shares by other means. As an alternative to selling under the Resale S-1, U.S. securities law permits investors to sell Conversion Shares under Rule 144 in certain circumstances. Beginning on October 27, 2021, the 91st day after Robinhood&rsquo;s GIP, the unlocked portion of the Conversion Shares will be eligible for sale in the public market under Rule 144. The portion of the Conversion Shares that remains subject to the lock-up agreements will be released and become eligible for sale in the public market 28 days after the Resale S-1 is declared effective (and no later than December 1, 2021). A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. Copies of the prospectus, when available, may be obtained from the SEC&rsquo;s website at www.sec.gov . These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.

2021-11-03 12:42:33	RDXW	Workhorse Stock Is Testing A Key Area Of Support: So Now What?	Workhorse Group Inc. (NASDAQ: RDXW ) shares are trading lower Wednesday, possibly after the company&rsquo;s 8-K form showed the company has entered into a securities exchange deal with Antara Capital for the exchange of $82.5 million in notes for 12.13 million shares of common stock. Workhorse was down 6.7% to $7.25. Workhorse Daily Chart Analysis The stock looks to be retesting support after being able to climb back above the previous support level in what technical traders call a sideways channel. The $18 price level is an area where the stock has had troubles getting above in the past. This area may continue to hold as resistance in the future. The $7 level once held as support and the stock recently crossed back above this level and is testing it as a support level once again. The stock trades below both the 50-day moving average (green) and the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating the stock is likely facing a period of bearish sentiment. Each of these moving averages may hold as a potential area of resistance in the future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is taking a slight breather and pushed down to 53 Wednesday. This shows overall the buying pressure still slightly outweighs the selling pressure. See Also: Workhorse Stock Needs To Reclaim This Support Level Or It Could Get Ugly What&rsquo;s Next For Workhorse? Bullish traders are hoping the stock can hold the $7 level as support once again. Bulls are then looking to see the start of higher lows and for the stock to head toward the resistance level, eventually seeing a potential break above it. Bearish traders are hoping the stock will be unable to hold the $7 level as support and for the stock to fall below it. Bears are then looking to see the stock start to hold this level as resistance for a possible further downward push.

The issue ended its inaugural session at $11.35, comfortably above the flooring level in SPAC issues at $10. Interestingly, the issue never reached the level it soared to ($14.38) on Dec. 28, when massive speculation in the SPAC sector sent several issues to levels they would never revisit. In fact, the issue peaked at $12.35 on its first day of trading and only surpassed it on one occasion, reaching $12.45 on March 3 but faltered to close that session at $9.62. It should be noted the issue has spent very little time at above that close ever since. Buyer Beware Under $10: In theory, there is a floor on the price of a SPAC issue before its acquisition is announced. In reality, once a deal is consummated and the new entity breaches $10, there is no true level of support below. How low the issue will fall is dependent on the fundamentals of the company and the Street&rsquo;s perception of the issue moving forward. On June 18, DLAC peaked at $10.02 and ended the session at $9.52 and was at $8 only two weeks later. Until this week, the all-time low was $6.38 and closed last Friday at $6.99. Say What? One week after announcing solid third-quarter earnings results, which caused a brief pop to $7.51 before fading by the close, the company dropped a bomb on shareholders. After this Tuesday's close, the company announced a 50 million share offering with its share price at a depressed level. From the price action on Wednesday and Thursday, it appeared there were no or few investors that wanted to be on the other side of the offering. This was evidenced by beating the issue took on Wednesday and into Thursday. In Thursday&rsquo;s session, the issue made a new all-time low ($5.41) and an all-time closing low ($5.52). Not So Fast: After the close on Thursday, the company announced that UWM Holdings and SFS Holding Corp, its principal shareholder, terminated the previously announced secondary offering of Class A Common Stock and concurrent stock repurchase effective immediately. The offering was intended to increase DLAC&rsquo;s public float by approximately 50%, thereby making it a more liquid, tradable stock for larger indexes and institutional investors, while at the same time utilizing the company&rsquo;s buyback authorization to reduce the number of fully diluted shares outstanding. However, the market&rsquo;s reaction to the Offering resulted in a share price level at which SFS is not willing to sell. With the termination of the offering, no shares of common stock will be sold by SFS at this time. Instead, the company intends to accelerate its previously announced buyback program and defer its plans to increase public float to a later date. PreMarket Prep Take: The indecisiveness of the company&rsquo;s top brass coupled with the recent price action prompted co-host Dennis Dick to tweet &quot;gift rally. Just my opinion.&quot; Price Action: After a much higher open ($6.69 versus $5.52), DLAC rallied to $7.03 (where it began the week) and sharply reversed course. As of 1:45 p.m. EST, it has continued to make new lows for the session, with the current one being at $6.44. In order to fill the void in price from last night&rsquo;s news, the issue would need to fall to $6.03.

The growth financing will be essential for us to expand our current allogeneic CAR F pipeline by continuing to exploit our differentiated, non-gene edited technologies and armored CAR F franchise.&rdquo; &ldquo;Celyad Oncology offers a unique optionality around its technology and intellectual property,&rdquo; said Christopher LiPuma, Director at Fortress. &ldquo;In particular, the Company&rsquo;s strong IP position around allogeneic CAR F stands out as a key asset that we believe will provide the foundation for the Company to strategically develop both novel cell therapy candidates and potential partnerships within the exciting off-the-shelf cell therapy landscape.&rdquo; SVB Leerink acted as the exclusive placement agent for the private placement, Goodwin Procter LLP and Harvest acted as legal counsel to the Company.

In addition, as long as Fortress holds 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company, certain intellectual property transactions will be subject to a 90% board majority for approval. Celyad will propose an amendment to its articles of association to reflect this qualified right. The securities to be issued in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or applicable state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.

2021-12-17 06:52:00	PIC	Becton, Dickinson Highlights Expansion Of Co.'s COR System To Include New MX Instrument For High-Throughput Molecular Testing For Infectious Diseases	BD COR&trade; MX for Infectious Disease Testing Receives CE Mark and is Final Instrument Introduced on BD COR&trade; System FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J., Dec. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: PIC ), a leading global medical technology company, today announced it has expanded the BD COR&trade; System to include a new MX instrument for high-throughput molecular testing for infectious diseases. The new instrument and its first test for sexually transmitted infections have been CE marked to the IVD directive 98/79/EC. The new MX instrument is the final piece of the BD COR&trade; System, which also includes a PX instrument that can prepare diagnostic samples by automating appropriate pre-analytical processing steps and a GX instrument that can leverage the BD Onclarity&trade; HPV Assay with extended genotyping to screen for HPV infections. The MX instrument is built off the proven BD UZA&trade; System molecular PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technology platform, a medium-throughput system typically found in hospital labs, and BD intends to leverage the BD UZA&trade; System menu of infectious disease tests to create assays that can be performed in high-throughput central reference labs on the BD COR&trade; System. The first test available on the MX instrument is the BD CTGCTV2 for BD COR&trade; System, which is designed to use a single test to detect the three most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infections &mdash; Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). In addition to CE mark, the BD CTGCTV2 for BD COR&trade; System assay was also included on the Australian Register for Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) following review by Australia's Medical Devices Regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). &quot;The BD COR&trade; PX/GX system is already used at laboratories across Europe and in Israel, helping to improve diagnostics and positively impact patient care,&quot; said Nikos Pavlidis, vice president of Molecular Diagnostics at BD. &quot;The availability of the MX instrument expands the use of the platform and automates testing for an expanding list of high-demand, essential assays for women's health and STI testing using multiplex PCR assay design, starting with BD's CTGCTV2 test.&quot; The BD COR&trade; MX/PX System allows 1,700 specimens to be loaded, with onboard capacity for reagents and samples that provide more than six hours of unimpeded system processing and up to 1,000 sample results in 24 hours, eliminating multiple technologist interactions currently required per shift. The BD COR&trade; System integrates and automates the complete molecular laboratory workflow from sample processing to diagnostic test result. The BD COR&trade; PX instrument integrates and automates the sample workflow for diagnostic specimens and assays, preparing the samples by performing the appropriate pre-analytical processing steps and automatically delivering the samples to the MX or GX instruments for molecular analysis. The MX instrument will perform the analytical steps of the BD CTGCTV2 molecular assay, including extraction, amplification and detection. Additional assays for the MX module are in development. The GX module is exclusively used for HPV testing. The BD COR&trade; PX/GX System has been in use in Europe since 2019. The system is modular and scalable, and designed to address multiple needs within laboratories for expanding molecular testing and increasing test volumes. The system is particularly well-suited to laboratories requiring high throughput for sample results and high capacity, minimizing staff interactions. The system enables the processing of samples directly from liquid-based cytology vials and other BD sample collection devices, and the creation of molecular aliquot tubes and assay testing &mdash; automating labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes.
