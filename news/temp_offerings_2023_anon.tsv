2023-02-01 09:37:07	ZUS	ZUS Works Around Shareholder Opposition For Capital Raise Via Dilutive Stock Sale	ZUS Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ZUS ) recently filed a proxy statement to convene a special shareholder meeting to discuss three proposals put forward by the company. The theater chain has used the filing to take an unpalatable proposition to its shareholders, Reuters said in a report. What Happened: ZUS, through the Jan. 27 proxy filing, sought shareholder approval for increasing its authorized shares. Instead of putting it forward as a straight proposal, the company bundled it with another proposal that seeks to convert its preferred stock into common stock, Reuters said. See also: Best High-Volume Penny Stocks Through the first proposal, the company has requested shareholders' nod for increasing its authorized shares from more than 524 million to 550 million. Proposal number: two from the company seeks approval for a 1:10 reverse stock split. ZUS noted that the increase in the authorized capital and the reverse split would permit the full conversion of all outstanding Series A preferred stock into common stock. ZUS's preferred equity units are trading under the ticker symbol APE on the NYSE. Each APE currently represented 1/00th of a share of Series A preferred stock. APE closed Tuesday&rsquo;s session at $2.42, up 3.86%, according to Benzinga Pro data. The common stock of ZUS, meanwhile, ended at $5.35, up 6.79%. ZUS noted that currently there were some 517 million outstanding common stock and almost 9.3 million Series of preferred stocks, which are represented by 929.8 million APEs. Post the approval, one APE will be equal to 1/10 of ZUS common stock, the company said. While ZUS would need 93 million new shares for the conversion, the company is seeking authorization for a total 498.2 million common shares, Reuters said, citing the filing. Following the conversion, the company will, therefore, be left with 405.2 million new common shares. At Tuesday&rsquo;s closing price, the new shares, less the ones used for conversion, are valued at $2.17 billion. Since preferred stockholders would also be allowed to vote on the proposal and there are 1.8 preferred shares for every common stock of ZUS, the former can sway the voting in favor of the authorization, Reuters said, citing corporate finance professors. The special meeting of shareholders is scheduled for March 14. Why It&rsquo;s Important: ZUS&rsquo;s fundamentals took a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic due to theater closures. As the company embarked on a recovery path following the pandemic, it resorted to stock sales to keep cash flowing in, averting a potential bankruptcy. ZUS capitalized on the meme stock frenzy that lifted its stock price to raise about $2 billion in 2021, Reuters said. However, as shareholders voiced opposition to dilution, ZUS canceled a shareholder meeting it convened in July 2021 to obtain approval for a fresh stock sale.

Announces $44M Equity Line Of Credit; Company States It Now Has A Funding Mechanism For Its Growth Plans In 2023 And Beyond	Gaucho Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: KCFS ), a company that includes a growing collection of e-commerce platforms with a concentration on fine wines, luxury real estate, and leather goods and accessories, announced today is growth strategy leveraging its previously announced $44 million ELOC. With this funding now in place, the Company believes it can lay the foundation for growth of its assets in lodging, hospitality, wine & spirits, retail, and e-commerce. With an approved $44 million equity line of credit, the Company states it now has a funding mechanism for its growth plans in 2023 and beyond. This includes infrastructure expansion for its luxury vineyard estate development, Algodon Wine Estates, such as the build out of residential villas and commercial elements associated with the estate's sports and hospitality sector, as well as marketing efforts targeting its lot sales program. The Company previously announced that it anticipates its lot sales program can potentially generate $5 Million or more in sales in 2023 alone, and its planned 60-room hotel and spa (which is also slated to include 30-50 residences, and for which the Company seeks to co-brand with a luxury hotel brand) could generate an additional $25 million per year of revenue once complete. With the Masterplan's addition of 200 more lots, ranging in size from 2.47 acres to 6 acres, the Company anticipates the potential to generate more than $100 million in revenue. Plans also target the Company's high end wine products, Algodon Fine Wines, which includes marketing efforts to further increase distribution channels, e-commerce sales and international markets, such as Argentina's neighbor Brazil, which is the world's 3rd largest market for online wine sales. The Company intends to continue efforts to scale the growth of its leather goods and accessories brand, Gaucho - Buenos Aires, which celebrated its flagship opening last year at the Miami Design District, located among the likes of widely recognized luxury retail brands such as Off White, Bottega Veneta, Gucci, and Chanel, and many others. The Company intends to target e-commerce revenue growth with an aggressive marketing campaign, as well the anticipated forthcoming launch of its Resort Collection and a luggage + travel accessories collection, later this year. Scott Mathis, CEO & Chairman of Gaucho Holdings commented; &quot;Being on the Nasdaq is very important for our company's loyal shareholders, future growth, and for maximizing exposure. As we grow and scale, we can leverage our stock as currency to accomplish a &quot;rollup&quot; strategy for accretive acquisitions such as additional luxury brands synergistic with our own. This $44 million ELOC can also go a long way for growth. In the next 24 to 36 months our extraordinary real estate project is expected to have a new destination spa, world class gym facilities, an 18-hole golf course expansion, and more vineyard casitas as well. Anticipated for q4 2023, the restaurant renovation and final touches on the upgrade to the winery will allow them to now accommodate weddings and corporate events, and other large gatherings. In addition, the San Rafael airport is being expanded and the runway improved for larger aircraft and more traffic. These can positively impact our ADRs and occupancy rates, as well as the value of our residential lots. Of our two hospitality properties, one of them currently generates positive cash flow through lease revenues and will be accretive to the company, and we expect the other to have substantial development opportunities. We believe both are in prime areas ripe for development, and we believe the valuation of the real estate is positioned to allow for substantial appreciation in the years ahead. Across all of our companies, we now have the means to up our game and get our story out to the world as we continue to grow.&quot;

The IMPRES trial, a previous Phase 3 trial, demonstrated that oral imatinib may produce a markedly greater, and much more durable, treatment effect on exercise tolerance, than any other available PAH treatment, alone or in combination, based on the results observed in those patients who were maintained on the full imatinib dose for the majority of the trial. Despite the availability of several classes of pulmonary vasodilators, no existing treatment has been shown to halt progression or induce regression of the disease. Imatinib acts on underlying cellular proliferative pathways associated with PAH and has the potential to be the first disease modifying therapy for PAH. About Levosimendan (TNX-101, TNX-102 and TNX-103) Levosimendan is a unique potassium ATP channel activator and calcium sensitizer that affects the heart and vascular system through multiple mechanisms of action. Initially discovered and developed by Orion Corporation in Finland, intravenous levosimendan is approved in over 60 countries outside the United States for use in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. Tenax Therapeutics has North American rights to develop and commercialize IV (TNX-101), subcutaneous (TNX-102), and oral (TNX-103) formulations of levosimendan. Results of Tenax Therapeutics' Phase 2 trial of levosimendan in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) demonstrated that IV levosimendan produces potent dilation of the central and pulmonary venous circulations which translates into an improvement in exercise capacity, a discovery that forms the basis for the Phase 3 investigation of Tenax Therapeutics' potential groundbreaking therapy. To date, no other drug therapy has improved exercise tolerance in patients with PH associated with HFpEF, recently referred to as the greatest unmet need in cardiovascular disease.

2023-03-08 09:18:50	EWQX	Rivian Prices $1.3B Green Note Offering, Sets Conversion Price At Premium: What Investors Should Know	Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: EWQX ) shares were seen moderately higher in premarket trading on Wednesday. What Happened: Rivian shares fell 14.54% on Tuesday. The company made an announcement concerning the proposed issue of $1.3 billion worth of green convertible, senior notes . The notes will accrue interest at a rate of 4.625% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and Sept. 15 each year. See Also: Is Rivian (EWQX) Stock A Good Buy Right Now The notes, issued through a private offering to qualified institutional investors, are due to mature on March 10, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Noteholders can exercise their right to convert the notes before Dec. 15, 2028, only upon the occurrence of certain events. Between this date and the maturity, they can opt to convert their notes at any time at their election. Rivian also said it will settle conversions by paying cash or delivering its Class A common stock or a combination of both, depending on its choice. The initial conversion rate is 49.6771 shares of its common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, working out to a conversion price of $20.13 per share. This represented a premium of 37.5% over Rivian&rsquo;s closing price of $14.64 per share on Tuesday. Rivian expects to raise net proceeds of $1.29 billion from the offering, with the amount increasing to $1.48 billion if initial purchasers exercise the option to purchase additional notes. Why It&rsquo;s Important: Rivian is facing supply chain issues, which have served to push out the lead times of its electric vehicles. The company&rsquo;s 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units issued in late February trailed the Street estimate for 60,000 units. The company is tapping debt financing at times credit conditions are tight. The premium conversion price it is offering for converting the notes to equity could act as a pulling point. The incremental capital will likely help plug in any potential hole left in its funding needs due to the slow production ramp. In premarket trading on Wednesday, Rivian shares were edging up 0.20% to $14.64, according to Benzinga Pro data. Check out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.

(NASDAQ: MKHP ) (&quot; Greenbrook &quot; or the &quot; Company &quot;) today announced that it has (i) completed a non-brokered private placement (the &quot; Private Placement &quot;) of common shares of the Company (the &quot; Common Shares &quot;) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately US$6.25 million, and (ii) entered into amendments to its credit facility (the &quot; Credit Facility &quot;) with Madryn Asset Management, LP and affiliates thereof (&quot; Madryn &quot;), whereby Madryn has agreed to extend two additional tranches of debt financing to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of US$2.0 million (the &quot; New Loan &quot;). Private Placement Pursuant to the Private Placement, an aggregate of 11,363,635 Common Shares were issued at a price of US$0.55 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of approximately US$6.25 million. The Private Placement included investments by Madryn, together with certain of the Company's other major shareholders, including Greybrook Health Inc. (&quot; Greybrook Health &quot;) and affiliates of Masters Special Situations LLC (&quot; Masters &quot;). The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement to finance the Company's previously announced ongoing restructuring plan (the &quot; Restructuring Plan &quot;) as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness. In connection with the Private Placement, all investors have received customary registration rights. The offer and sale of the Common Shares in the Private Placement was made in the United States solely to accredited investors pursuant to the exemption from registration in reliance on a private placement exemption under Section 4(a)(2) under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot; Securities Act &quot;) and in Canada pursuant to and in compliance with exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy &lrm;any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be &lrm;unlawful.&lrm; Madryn Debt Financing Madryn has agreed to extend two additional tranches of the New Loan to the Company, each in the amount of US$1.0 million, representing an aggregate principal amount of US$2.0 million. US$1.0 million of the New Loan was funded prior to closing of the Private Placement, with the balance expected to be funded by the end of the month. The terms and conditions of the New Loan are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Company's existing aggregate US$59.0 million loan under the Credit Facility (the &quot; Existing Loan &quot; and together with the New Loan, the &quot; Madryn Loan &quot;) in all material respects. The New Loan also provides Madryn with the option to convert up to approximately US$182,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the New Loan into Common Shares at a conversion price per share equal to US$1.90 (the &quot; Conversion Price &quot;), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. This conversion feature corresponds to the conversion provisions for the Existing Loan, which provide Madryn with the option to convert up to approximately US$5.4 million of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Loan into Common Shares at the Conversion Price. After giving effect to the New Loan, an aggregate of approximately US$5.6 million of the Madryn Loan is convertible into Common Shares at the Conversion Price. Following completion of the Private Placement and the New Loan, and in conjunction with anticipated cost savings from the Restructuring Plan, the Company intends to continue to explore additional options to enhance and strengthen its liquidity position and enable the Company to meet its cash requirements. MI 61-101 Disclosure Greybrook Health is an insider of the Company. Accordingly, the Private Placement is considered a &quot;related party transaction&quot; for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 &ndash; Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (&quot; MI 61-101 &quot;). Pursuant to MI 61-101, the Company will file a material change report providing disclosure in relation to each &quot;related party transaction&quot; on SEDAR under the Company's issuer profile at www.sedar.com . The Company did not file the material change report more than 21 days before the expected closing date of the Private Placement as the details of the Private Placement and the participation therein by the &quot;related parties&quot; of the Company were not settled until shortly prior to the closing of the Private Placement, and the Company wished to close the Private Placement on an expedited basis for business reasons. The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements available under MI 61-101.

An early-stage trial of the drug, dubbed AXA1125, with the University of Oxford, found that participants given the treatment significantly improved fatigue compared with those in the placebo arm, according to the results published Friday in the Lancet eClinical Medicine journal. &quot;There is still some way to go in treating all patients with long Covid &ndash; our results focus specifically on fatigue, rather than the breathlessness and cardiovascular issues that other long Covid patients have reported,&quot; Bloomberg reported citing a statement from Betty Raman, the trial's principal investigator. Axcella's Phase 2a trial results demonstrated statistically and clinically relevant improvement in fatigue in patients with Long COVID. The study, which did not meet an experimental biomarker primary endpoint, found that subjects who received AXA1125 experienced clinically and statistically significant improvement in mental (p=0.0097) and physical (p=0.0097) fatigue scores compared to placebo subjects . Axcella discontinued its Phase 2b trial of AXA1125 in NASH . Axcella reported data from Phase 2b EMMPACT study of AXA1125 for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). AXA1125 showed a statistically significant improvement in liver stiffness at a higher dose but did not reach statistical significance at a lower dose . Half of the 41 patients in the trial received the drug twice daily for four weeks. Participants generally suffered fatigue following Covid for 18 months before the study. Axcella has the U.S. and the U.K. regulatory authorization to proceed with advanced trials, and the company plans to enroll about 300 people once funding is secured. Price Action: FWGE shares are up 3.33% at $0.39 on the last check Friday.

2023-04-24 11:33:04	KVAW	Applied Therapeutics' Investigational Drug Shows Clinical Benefit In Rare Metabolic Disorder, Chalks Out FDA Submission Plans	Applied Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: KVAW ) announced results from the ACTION-Galactosemia Kids study of govorestat (AT-007) for galactosemia, a rare genetic metabolic disease resulting in an inability to metabolize the simple sugar galactose. When not appropriately metabolized, galactose is converted to the toxic metabolite, galactitol, which causes neurological complications. Treatment with govorestat demonstrated consistent and sustained clinical benefits in activities of daily living, behavioral symptoms, cognition, adaptive behavior, and tremors. While statistical significance defined as a p-value of <0.05 was not met on the primary endpoint, a systematic improvement over time was demonstrated for the overall primary endpoint (p=0.1030) and pre-specified sensitivity analyses, including cognition (p=0.0698). Individual speech and language components of the primary endpoint were not impacted, which is suspected to be due to a lack of progression in the placebo group and concomitant speech therapy received by almost all children in the trial. A post-hoc analysis of the global statistical test, including behavior and activities of daily living but excluding speech & language components, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of active treatment vs. placebo (p=0.0205), which strengthened over time. Govorestat provided a statistically significant benefit on tremors at 18 months (p=0.0428). Govorestat continued to be safe and well-tolerated in all age groups; no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. The company plans to request a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss a potential NDA submission in 2H of 2023; it plans to submit a European Marketing Authorization Application in mid-2023 . Concurrently, Applied Therapeutics announced a private placement of 9.7 million shares at $0.946 per share and 22 million pre-funded warrants at $0.945 for a gross proceed of $30 million.

Tender Offer The Company intends to commence the tender offer today, May 11, 2023. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 9, 2023, unless extended or earlier terminated (the &quot;expiration date&quot;).

Tendered shares of common stock may only be withdrawn on or before the expiration date. The tender offer will be subject to various terms and conditions as will be described in the Offer to Purchase.

However, given that we are unable at this time to provide shareholders with a definitive timeframe on when we expect to have completed that evaluation or to predict what steps we will take following our evaluation, we believe it is in the best interest of both the Company and its shareholders to provide the opportunity for existing, and in some cases long-time, shareholders to move on, while still allowing those dedicated to the Company to remain for what may be a very long process until regulatory approval of any commercial asset. Based on our current cash position, in-house assets, and a simultaneous search for additional assets that we believe would be accretive to the Company, we believe our current strategy and activities have the highest potential to maximize shareholder value. Our financing helps to maintain our very favorable cash position, and we are grateful to all of our shareholders, regardless of their actions around this tender offer, for their loyalty and patience in this continued time of transition for the Company. We look forward to the time when we are able to provide more specific updates regarding Cell-in-a-Box or a potential strategic acquisition.&quot; The tender offer described in this press release has not yet commenced.

This resubmission responds to the Complete Response Letter issued by the FDA in February 2023 concerning specifications and controls for a nitrosamine drug substance-related impurity, N-nitroso-vonoprazan (NVP) . The resubmission contains three months of stability data for six batches of the reformulated vonoprazan tablets. The three-month data demonstrate Phathom's mitigation measures control NVP growth through three months and keep levels well below the acceptable daily intake limit of 96 ng/day. All of the manufactured reformulated batches have demonstrated control of NVP through three months of long-term stability conditions that are more than tenfold below the acceptable intake limit, which Phathom believes supports the requested shelf life of 24 months. Phathom expects the application to be classified as a Class 2 resubmission with a six-month review period and plans to provide the FDA with six-month stability data from its ongoing stability program during the regulatory review process. A combined U.S. commercial launch for the Erosive GERD and L. pylori indications is planned for the fourth quarter of 2023 if approved.

2023-06-07 09:00:45	GQNG	Why TransCode Therapeutics Stock Is Trading Higher Premarket Today	TransCode Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: GQNG ) announced acceptance for publication by Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences of a preclinical study using TransCode's lead therapeutic candidate, TTX-MC138, in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) . The findings of this study support further development of TTX-MC138 for GBM by identifying a potentially successful combination treatment protocol using TTX-MC138 with temozolomide (TMZ), currently the standard-of-care therapeutic. Treatment of human glioblastoma cells implanted in animals with the TTX-MC138 analog, MN-anti-miR10b, inhibited tumor cell growth and induced cell death. When combined with a sub-therapeutic dose of TMZ in a sequence-specific protocol, MN-anti-miR10b enhanced the cell-killing ability of TMZ, resulting in highly successful inhibition of tumor cell survival and invasiveness. The company says that in a preclinical model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, administration of TTX-MC138 as monotherapy resulted in complete responses, manifested as regression without recurrence, in 40% of treated animals. This study comes on the heels of preclinical breast cancer studies demonstrating complete metastatic disease regressions. In addition to murine models of cancer, TTX-MC138 was successfully delivered and demonstrated preliminary efficacy in a case study of spontaneous feline mammary carcinoma. TransCode also priced its public offering of 2 million shares at $3.50 per share for gross proceeds of $7 million. Each common stock is offered with a Series A-1 warrant to purchase one share at an exercise price of $3.25 per share and a Series A-2 warrant to purchase one share at an exercise price of $3.25 per share . Price Action: GQNG shares are up 6.54% at $3.42 during the premarket session on the last check Wednesday.

The shares underlying the Convertible Notes and the Warrants are subject to a one-year lock up and are expected to be registered for resale on a registration statement on Form S-3 after February 6, 2024. &quot;Our ability to attract both existing and new investors to complete a second funding transaction this month provides further indication that our next-generation technology and market opportunity are resonating with the financial community,&quot; said Dr. Mark Zediker, CEO and Co-Founder of the Company. &quot;This additional capital will help us continue our commercialization and execute our product development roadmap and deliver dramatically improved manufacturing capabilities to our customers in our primary markets: welding, metal additive 3D printing and consumer electronics.&quot; The Convertible Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at the rate of seven percent per year and are payable on the earlier of June 23, 2026, or the occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes may be converted at any time following June 23, 2023, prior to the payment in full of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes at the Investor's option. In the event of the Sale of the Company (as defined in the Convertible Notes), the outstanding principal amount of each Convertible Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest not otherwise converted into equity securities pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes, shall (i) if the Investor so elects, be converted into equity securities pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes (the &quot;Conversion Shares&quot;) at a price equal to $0.688 (subject to appropriate adjustment from time to time for any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event) (the &quot;Conversion Price&quot;), or (ii) be due and payable immediately prior to the closing of such Sale of the Company, together with a premium equal to 150% of the principal amount to be prepaid. Subsequent to the effectiveness of a registration statement registering the Registrable Securities (as defined below), the Company may elect to pay interest in kind through the issuance of shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price, in lieu of payments in cash (the &quot;Interest Shares&quot;). The Warrants issued by the Company to the Investors pursuant to the Purchase Agreement entitle the relevant Investor to purchase that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock (the &quot;Warrant Shares&quot;) determined by dividing the principal amount of each Convertible Note by the Conversion Price. The Warrants have an exercise price equal to $1.03, which represent a 50% premium over the exercise price, and expire on June 23, 2028. According to the NYSE American LLC Company Guide, consummating the transactions pursuant to the Purchase Agreement would ordinarily require the approval of the Company's stockholders. However, the Company has sought and received from NYSE American LLC an exception from obtaining such stockholder approval pursuant to Section 710(b) of the Company Guide. A special committee of the Company's Board of Directors, comprised solely of independent, disinterested directors, has expressly approved the Company's reliance on this exception, and the transaction was also unanimously approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Northland Capital Markets acted as financial advisor to the Company. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy Convertible Notes or Warrants, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

2023-07-24 07:01:26	ZUS	Why ZUS Shares Are Ripping Higher Premarket Today	Shares of ZUS Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ZUS ) are skyrocketing before the opening bell on Monday, extending the strength from Friday's after-hours session. The spike was in reaction to the Delaware Court of Chancery's ruling against a settlement proposed by the company that will allow it to convert its preferred equity shares known as APEs into common shares and implement a 10-for-1 reverse stock split. ZUS intended to do the transactions to be able to sell additional shares and raise capital to avert potential bankruptcy. This was met with opposition from certain shareholders, who sued to block the transactions. The company later reached a settlement with these shareholders, agreeing to give an extra share for every 7.5 shares owned. Other investors, who rejected the settlement, took up their objections with the Delaware court ahead of a two-day trial held last month. In an open letter tweeted on Sunday, ZUS CEO Adam Aron said raising fresh equity in the near term is critical to the company. The company is working to address the concern raised in the Delaware Court of Chancery's ruling on Friday, he said. He also emphasized the inability to raise capital materially increases the company running out of cash in 2024 or 2025, or being unable to refinance and stretch out the maturity of some of its debt. Aron also called out for support to beat the short thesis, which according to him, will be possible only if the bankruptcy risk is off the table. In premarket trading on Monday, ZUS shares rallied 48.18% to $6.52 and APE preferred units traded up 1.11% at $1.82, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The ENVISION trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that patients treated with UGN-102 had a 79.2% rate of complete response at 3 months following the initial treatment. Additional data evaluating the secondary endpoint of the duration of response from ENVISION and the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) (assuming additional positive findings) to the FDA are anticipated in 2024.

(NASDAQ: RDXW ) (&quot;Workhorse&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero emission commercial vehicles, today mailed a letter to Workhorse stockholders from its CEO Rick Dauch providing context on why Workhorse stockholders should vote FOR the proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of Workhorse common stock in connection with the upcoming Special Meeting. Workhorse also launched a website in connection with the Special Meeting, which has information for stockholders regarding the proposal and how to vote: www.VoteWKHS.com . The full text of the letter being mailed to stockholders follows: Dear Fellow Workhorse Stockholders, I am reaching out so you can hear directly from me about where Workhorse is today and why we need your help to build a bridge to continued growth and long-term stockholder value creation. We are asking our stockholders to approve an increase in our authorized common stock and I am asking for you to support the future of Workhorse by voting in favor TODAY. When I joined Workhorse as CEO in August 2021, I knew there was incredible potential, but that there were also a number of legacy issues we needed to solve for first. Since then, we have transformed the business, executing a clear strategy to stabilize, fix and ultimately grow Workhorse into a viable commercial EV OEM. We have revamped our management team, bringing in industry veterans and experts to lead the Company and execute our plans. These business leaders, engineers, operational, supply chain, sales professionals, and plant management have the necessary skills and relevant expertise to develop and advance the initiatives underway across the Company. To facilitate our growth, we have revitalized our facilities , bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the Midwest. I grew up in Indiana and Michigan, and I am extremely proud of what we are building here in the heartland of the United States. In addition to our other facilities, we have completely transformed our Union City, Indiana plant into a world-class manufacturing complex that is ramping up production of our electric vehicles. We have also created a world class technology development and manufacturing site here in Ohio for our Aerospace business. We have developed and are advancing a clear product roadmap, targeting the CL4-6 work truck and step-van segment . Production of our flagship W56 vehicles is on track to begin in September, and customer interest for this commercial vehicle is extremely high. We have already ramped up production of our W4 CC vehicle and initial deliveries of the W750 step-van were made in Q2 this year. Longer-term, we are developing WNext , a next-generation vehicle with improved capabilities, safety systems and technology, over the next three years. At the same time, we are building out our commercial footprint. We have announced partnerships with several regional EV dealers and are continuing to expand our dealership network further in the coming years. In addition to our commercial EVs, we have continued to invest in our Aerospace business and pursue key contracts. We recently signed our first commercial drone purchase orders for our industry leading HorseflyTM product and are holding demonstrations for potential last-mile delivery customers, industry partners, government agencies and officials. In addition, we developed our FALCONTM product, designed purposedly for austere work environments, in less than five months. We have also earned multiple grants or contracts from both Federal and State governments to perform &lsquo;drones as a service' tasks across the country. Finally, we have strengthened the Company's financial position . We addressed balance sheet issues and resolved legacy legal liabilities, providing us with the financial flexibility to invest in our turnaround efforts to date. Our focused efforts have put us on the precipice of success, ready to emerge as not only a survivor but as a leader in the transition to an EV powered system, both on the ground and in the air. I have held executive leadership positions at multiple companies across the global automotive industry over my 30-year career. I know what it takes to succeed, and I am confident in our team, plans and opportunities to do so here at Workhorse. That said, as we look ahead, we need to ensure we have the necessary financial resources to &quot;complete the transition&quot; and are evaluating a range of options to fund our next phase of production and profitable growth. We are contemplating transactions involving common stock or the issuance of equity-linked securities, including convertible debt. These options will only be available to us if we have the flexibility to issue more shares of our stock. This is why we need your help to build a bridge to continued growth and long-term stockholder value. To continue on our journey, we need our stockholders to vote FOR the proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of Workhorse common stock. I am incredibly proud of the progress we are making, and I have the utmost confidence in our path forward to deliver growth, profitability, and stockholder value. We appreciate your support and thank you in advance for voting FOR Workhorse's future. Sincerely, Rick Dauch CEO Workhorse Group

2023-08-07 10:48:53	GFRT	Reported Earlier, GFRT Announces Proposed Private Offering Of $350M Green Exchangeable Senior Unsecured Notes And Intention To Enter Into Capped Call Transactions	Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (&quot;GFRT,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) (NYSE: GFRT ), a leading investor in climate solutions, today announced, subject to market conditions, a private offering of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of green exchangeable senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the &quot;Notes&quot;) by its indirect subsidiaries, HAT Holdings I LLC (&quot;HAT I&quot;) and HAT Holdings II LLC (&quot;HAT II,&quot; and together with HAT I, the &quot;Issuers&quot;). At issuance, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Company, Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure, L.P. and Hannon Armstrong Capital, LLC. The Issuers also expect to grant the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, during the 13-day period beginning on, and including the first date on which the Notes are issued, up to $52.5 million additional aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase certain of the 2023 Convertible Notes as described below. Additionally, the Company intends to use cash on hand to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions as described below. The Company intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds of the offering to acquire, invest in or refinance, in whole or in part, new and/or existing eligible green projects. Investment opportunities have already been identified and are consistent with the Company's normal course investment profile. In addition, these eligible green projects may include projects with disbursements made during the twelve months preceding the issue date of the Notes and those with disbursements to be made following the issue date. Prior to the full investment of such net proceeds, the Company intends to invest such net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities which are consistent with the Company's intention to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT. The Notes will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2024 until the maturity date, unless the Notes are earlier repurchased, redeemed or exchanged in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Upon any exchange of the Notes, holders will receive cash, shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the &quot;Common Stock&quot;) or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at the Company's election, based on the exchange rate for the Notes. The exchange rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may redeem the Notes if GFRT's board of directors determines such redemption is reasonably necessary to preserve its qualification as a REIT or, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, on or after August 20, 2026 and prior to the 62nd scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, under certain circumstances. Any shares of Common Stock issuable upon exchange of the Notes will have certain registration rights. The interest rate, exchange rate and other terms of the Notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the Notes in the offering, the Company may enter into separate and individually negotiated transactions with certain holders of its 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the &quot;2023 Convertible Notes&quot;) to repurchase for cash certain of the 2023 Convertible Notes (the &quot;concurrent note repurchases&quot;). The terms of any concurrent note repurchases are anticipated to be individually negotiated with each holder of the 2023 Convertible Notes and will depend on several factors, including the market price of the Common Stock and the trading price of the 2023 Convertible Notes at the time of each such concurrent note repurchase. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the 2023 Convertible Notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. The Company expects that certain holders of any 2023 Convertible Notes that the Company agrees to repurchase that have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such 2023 Convertible Notes will, concurrently with the pricing of the Notes offered hereby, unwind all or part of their hedge positions by buying the Common Stock and/or entering into or various unwinding derivative transactions with respect to the Common Stock. Any repurchase of the 2023 Convertible Notes, and the potential related market activities by holders of the 2023 Convertible Notes participating in the concurrent note repurchases, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Common Stock, which may affect the trading price of the Notes at that time and the initial exchange price of the Notes. The Company cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the Notes or the Common Stock. In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company expects the Issuers will enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates or other financial institutions (the &quot;option counterparties&quot;). The capped call transactions are expected to cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the same number of shares of the Common Stock that will initially underly the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common and/or offset potential cash payments the Issuers are required to make in excess of the principal amount, in each case, upon any exchange of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the market price per share of Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties (and/or their respective affiliates) have advised the Issuers that they expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Common Stock and/or purchase shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or the Issuers in secondary market transactions concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes, including with certain investors in the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Common Stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties (and/or their respective affiliates) may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Common Stock and/or purchasing or selling shares of the Common Stock or other securities of the Company or the Issuers in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to an exchange of Notes or following any early exchange, redemption or repurchase of Notes). The effect, if any, of these activities on the market price of the Common Stock or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of the Common Stock or the Notes, which could affect the holders' ability to exchange the Notes, and it could affect the amount of cash and/or the number and value of the shares of the Common Stock holders receive upon exchange of the Notes. The Notes and the related guarantees will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Securities Act&quot;). The Notes and the related guarantees will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Management Comments & Pipeline Societal is a bi-coastal RLVE with capabilities spanning pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) development to commercial manufacturing and packaging for a range of therapeutic dosage forms. CEO David Enloe says the second quarter was a &ldquo;highly productive&rdquo; period, with Societal continuing to &ldquo;aggressively pursue and win&rdquo; new business -including psychedelic drug development - and expand programs with existing customers. Nonetheless, he added, the period was not without challenges, as customers continue to face an &ldquo;unfavorable&rdquo; financing environment, which leads management to believe that Societal&rsquo;s EBITDA guidance requires revision. &ldquo;We had previously guided to a 2023 full year EBITDA of between $15 and $18 million. Today we are revising this guidance to between $12 and $15 million,&rdquo; Enloe said. Despite this, &ldquo;Societal&rsquo;s operations and business fundamentals remain solid: subsequent to the quarter end, we further stabilized our position by successfully renegotiating our debt and certain covenants to provide a stronger balance sheet today and greater financial flexibility for the future.&rdquo; As much as we cover the psychedelics sector, we own expertise in the cannabis world.

(the &quot;Fund&quot;); (ii) a modification to the Fund's Self-Tender Policy; and (iii) the indefinite suspension of the Fund's Managed Distribution Policy. Rights Offer Under the terms of the rights offer (the &quot;Rights Offer&quot;), the Fund will issue non-transferable rights (the &quot;Rights&quot;) to its stockholders of record on a date to be disclosed in the prospectus (the &quot;Record Date&quot;). Each stockholder of record on the Record Date will receive one Right for each full share of the Fund's Common Stock owned on the Record Date. The Rights will entitle the holders to purchase one share of the Fund's Common Stock for every one Right held, and stockholders of record on the Record Date who fully exercise their Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional shares of Common Stock (&quot;Over-Subscription Shares&quot;) subject to the limitation set forth in the prospectus. The Over-Subscription Shares will be allocated pro rata to stockholders who over-subscribe based on the number of Rights originally issued to them. The Fund may increase the number of shares of Common Stock subject to subscription by up to 200% of the shares. The rights are non-transferable and, therefore, may not be purchased or sold. The shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Rights Offer will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol &quot;FROC.&quot; The subscription price per share will be 92% of the average volume-weighted closing sale price at which the Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the Expiration Date (as defined in the prospectus) and the four preceding trading days. The Registration Statement relating to the Rights Offer has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. Final terms and important details of the proposed Rights Offer, including but not limited to the Record Date, Subscription Price and Expiration Date, will be determined at a later date and disclosed in the prospectus. Subject to making the necessary filings with the SEC and the Registration Statement being declared effective, it is expected that the Rights Offer will commence in October 2023. The securities to be offered may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time that the Registration Statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the securities to be offered in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. Self-Tender Policy In addition, the Fund's Board of Directors has modified the Fund's Self-Tender Policy. Under the terms of the Self-Tender Policy, the Fund has undertaken to commence a tender offer for its shares of common stock by October 31, 2023. Because of the uncertainty regarding the timing of the Rights Offer, the Board of Directors of the Fund modified the Self-Tender Policy to allow for the Fund to commence the tender offer within a reasonable amount of time following the conclusion of the Rights Offer. The formal offer and detailed terms of the tender offer will be announced following the conclusion of the Rights Offer. The above statements are not intended to constitute an offer to participate in any tender offer. Stockholders will be notified of the terms of the tender offer in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, either by publication or mailing or both. The tender offer will be made by an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal, and other documents to be filed with the SEC. Stockholders of the Fund should read the offer to purchase and tender offer statement and related exhibits when those documents are filed and become available, as they will contain important information about the tender offer. These and other filed documents will be available to investors for free both at the website of the SEC ( www.sec.gov ) and from the Fund ( www.herzfeld.com/cuba ). Managed Distribution Policy Additionally, the Fund's Board of Directors has indefinitely suspended the Fund's Managed Distribution Policy.

Under Josh's leadership, a compelling clinical program designed to investigate Lomecel-B&#x2122; in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS), Alzheimer's disease, and Aging-related Frailty has been established. To execute this program, we have taken steps to strengthen our Board and executive leadership team, and initiated the $30 million Rights Offering we announced on August 14, 2023. I write to you today to highlight the progress we are making and to discuss what these steps mean for our shared future. Lomecel-B &#x2122; – Realizing the Potential of Medicinal Signaling Cells Lomecel-B&#x2122; is a living cell product made from specialized cells isolated from the bone marrow of young healthy adult donors. These specialized cells, known as medicinal signaling cells (MSCs), are essential to our endogenous biological repair mechanism. MSCs have been shown to perform a number of complex functions in the body, including the formation of new tissue. They also have been shown to respond to sites of injury or disease and secrete bioactive factors that are immunomodulatory and regenerative. We believe that Lomecel-B&#x2122; may have multiple potential mechanisms of action that may lead to anti-inflammatory, provascular regenerative responses, and therefore may have broad application for a range of rare and aging related diseases. Our ongoing trials are all progressing and nearing important clinical milestones. As we announced recently, our Phase 2 ELPIS II trial in HLHS has exceeded its 50% enrollment threshold, and we have added an additional study location to further expedite enrollment, and we anticipate completing enrollment in this trial in 2024. New long-term survival data from our prior ELPIS I trial showed that children treated with Lomecel-B&#x2122; had 100% survival up to five years of age compared to approximate 20% mortality rate observed from historical control data. The potential of Lomecel-B&#x2122; in this indication was further highlighted in the Key Opinion Leader webinar we hosted in August, a replay of which is available here . In Alzheimer's disease, our CLEAR MIND Phase 2a trial is on track to report top-line results in October, 2023. In a previously completed Phase 1 study, we reported preliminary safety data of Lomecel-B&#x2122; used in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. With the Phase 2a CLEAR MIND trial, we hope to build on those results and further demonstrate the potential of Lomecel-B&#x2122; as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. In our Aging-related Frailty program, earlier this year we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial, evaluating Lomecel-B&#x2122; in this indication in Japan, a country with one of the oldest populations in the world. Enrollment is continuing, and the trial is expected to enroll 45 patients. The primary endpoint of this Phase 2 trial is to evaluate safety with an overarching goal of providing support for an eventual limited approval under the Japan's Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine, or ASRM, which recognizes the tremendous potential, therapeutic potential of cell therapies. Organizational Strength To execute these compelling programs, over the last several weeks we have taken steps to strengthen Longeveron at both the Board and executive leadership level. In June, we announced the election of seasoned biotechnology and corporate management experts Khoso Baluch and Jeffrey Pfeffer to our Board of Directors, and I am pleased to join them on our Board to serve in this capacity. We also announced the appointment of Lisa Locklear as our Chief Financial Officer, and Dr. Nataliya Agafonova as Chief Medical Officer. Both Lisa and Nataliya have had distinguished careers in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, and we look forward to their guidance as we advance clinical development of Lomecel-B&#x2122;. Rights Offering – Balanced Approach for Needed Capital On June 27,2023, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to conduct a tradeable subscription rights offering for up to $30.0 million of shares of Class A common stock to stockholders and holders of warrants to purchase common stock as the record date of August 18, 2023. We believe this Rights Offering provides a balanced approach to raising capital necessary to fund clinical development of Lomecel-B&#x2122; while remaining cognizant not to dilute existing shareholders. We believe this is an opportunity to participate for all shareholders, and is an important step in fully realizing the potential of Lomecel-B&#x2122; and to generating long-term shareholder value. To conclude, we believe strongly in the potential of Lomecel-B&#x2122; in the therapeutic areas we have under investigation, and in the leadership team we've assembled to advance our development programs toward near-term milestones. Together with our fellow stockholders, we are confident we can bring this potentially lifesaving therapy to patients in need. On behalf of my colleagues and the Longeveron Board of Directors, thank you for your continued support.

When issued, the Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of THI. The 2029 Notes will mature on October 15, 2029 and the 2030 Notes will mature on October 15, 2030, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Holders may convert the Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver to such converting holders, as the case may be, cash, the Company's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs""), each currently representing one Class A ordinary share of the Company, or a combination of cash and ADSs, at the Company's election. After the resale restriction termination date (as will be defined in the terms of the Notes) and pursuant to the applicable procedures and requirements, holders who receive ADSs upon conversion of the Notes may surrender such ADSs to the Company's ADS depositary for exchange into Class A ordinary shares for trading on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the ""Hong Kong Stock Exchange"") or the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (""SGX-RT""). The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the Notes. The Company may redeem for cash all but not part of the 2029 Notes and/or the 2030 Notes if less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of the Notes originally issued remains outstanding at such time. In addition, the Company may redeem all but not part of the 2029 Notes and/or the 2030 Notes in the event of certain changes in the tax laws. On or after October 22, 2027, in the case of the 2029 Notes, and on or after October 22, 2028, in the case of the 2030 Notes, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the relevant series of the Notes, subject to certain conditions. Any redemption may occur only prior to the 20th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the relevant maturity date. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Notes on October 15, 2027, in the case of the 2029 Notes, or October 15, 2028, in the case of the 2030 Notes, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. Holders of the Notes have the option, subject to certain conditions, to require the Company to repurchase any Notes held in the event of a fundamental change. The Company plans to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to repurchase a portion of the existing debt securities, and the remainder mainly to further strengthen its balance sheet position as well as for general corporate purposes. The Company expects that holders and potential purchasers of the Company's debt securities may employ a convertible arbitrage strategy to hedge their exposure in connection with the relevant securities. Any such activities by holders of the relevant debt securities and/or potential investors in the Notes could affect the market price of the ADSs and Class A ordinary shares and/or the trading price of such debt securities. The Notes, the ADSs deliverable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, and the Class A ordinary shares represented thereby, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or securities laws of any other places. They may not be offered or sold, except to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

2023-09-25 07:38:11	THI	Why Nio Shares Are Cratering Over 6% Premarket Today	Shares of Chinese electric vehicle startup Nio, Inc. (NYSE: THI ) slumped in premarket on Monday, as a host of factors weighed down. In premarket trading, the stock fell 6.33% to $7.99, according to Benzinga Pro data. Some of the weaknesses reflected the negative sentiment set in motion by a slide in Chinese property stocks in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. The property stocks reacted to Evergrande stating that it was not able to raise debt due to an investigation into its principal subsidiary. The Hong Kong-listed shares of Nio closed Monday's session down 4.60%. The broader market sentiment ahead of the opening was one of caution despite the four-day losing streak, as bond yields continue to rise. See Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks Nio could also be reacting to a Bloomberg report that said the company is looking at the prospect of raising $3 billion and has approached Middle East investors in this regard. The Shanghai-based company recently announced a $1 billion convertible senior debt offering. In a release on Monday, the company said it has closed the offering. EV manufacturing is a capital-intensive business and given Nio is still making losses and it has an ambitious expansion plan, funding could be key to keep the operations going. That said, investors will likely react to negatively to any additional stock offering due to its dilutive influence on the stock price.

The company noted that Pride of America, which offers year-round inter-island Hawaii itineraries, modified certain itineraries in August to avoid stressing local resources in Maui. The wildfires also led to a slowdown in close-in bookings for sailings in Hawaii, primarily concentrated in the fourth quarter of 2023. Pride of America accounts for approximately 3% of the cruiseliner&rsquo;s capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, after the escalation of the conflict in Israel , Norwegian Cruise Line is canceling and redirecting all calls to Israel for the remainder of 2023. Prior to the conflict, approximately 6% of the company&rsquo;s capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023 had visits to Israel. As of October 5, 2023, Norwegian had hedged approximately 45%, 35% and 5% of its total projected metric tons of fuel consumption for the remainder of 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively in order to mitigate the impact of fuel price volatility. GPEZ also said it continues to experience strong consumer demand and remains at its optimal booked position on a 12-month forward basis.

The intravenous VZNI-001 program, which features a shorter infusion time and fewer infusions compared to the currently marketed IGF-1R inhibitor, is on track for its Phase 3 data readouts. The company expects that its intravenous VZNI-001 has the potential to establish a strong foothold in the multi-billion-dollar TED commercial market and will help facilitate the future introduction of its subcutaneous program. Viridian is on track to select its lead subcutaneous IGF-1R program by the end of 2023 and expects such program to enter a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial in mid-2024. The company expects topline results from the first THRIVE Phase 3 clinical trial for intravenous VZNI-001 for active TED to be available in mid-2024. The THRIVE-2 clinical trial in chronic TED patients is recruiting patients, and the company expects topline clinical results by year end 2024. Next Generation FcRn Inhibitor Portfolio Unveiled; First IND Filing Planned by Year End 2024 Consistent with Viridian's vision to develop the next generation of best-in-class products for severe autoimmune and rare diseases, the company disclosed that it is developing a portfolio of engineered FcRn inhibitors, VZNI-006 and VZNI-008. FcRn inhibitors have the potential to treat a broad array of autoimmune diseases, representing a significant commercial market opportunity. Viridian's multi-pronged engineering approach has resulted in a portfolio of FcRn-targeting molecules that leverage the clinically and commercially validated mechanism of FcRn inhibition while potentially addressing the limitations of current agents such as incomplete IgG suppression and needed improvements in safety. VZNI-006 is a FcRn-targeting Fc fragment, and in non-human primate studies, demonstrated specificity for blocking FcRn-IgG interactions while showing no increases in albumin or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. In head-to-head non-human primate studies, VZNI-006 demonstrated comparable potency and IgG lowering to efgartigimod, the current standard of care in FcRn inhibition, as well as a similar safety profile. Viridian plans to file an IND for VZNI-006 by year end 2024 and expects healthy volunteer data for VZNI-006 in the second half of 2025. VZNI-008 is a novel, first-in-class FcRn inhibitor that aims to pair IgG suppression with extended half-life technology, potentially enabling deeper and more durable suppression than existing anti-FcRn therapies. Both molecules are designed to be convenient, self-administered, subcutaneous products. The company plans to share additional details about its FcRn portfolio in 2024. $185 Million Financing to Fund Expanded Pipeline and Extend Cash Runway Viridian announced it has entered into agreements for a private placement financing that is expected to close by November 1, 2023, and result in anticipated gross proceeds of approximately $185 million, before deducting estimated offering expenses. The financing was led by Fairmount Funds with participation from both existing investors, including Braidwell LP, Commodore Capital, Deep Track Capital, Venrock, Paradigm BioCapital and Perceptive Advisors, as well as new investors, including entities managed by RTW Investments, LP and Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company). In the private placement, Viridian is selling an aggregate of 8,789,022 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.38 per share and an aggregate of 92,312 shares of its Series B preferred stock at a price of $825.3746 per share, which are convertible into approximately 6,154,441 shares of common stock, subject to beneficial ownership conversion limits. Proceeds will be used to fund pipeline programs, including the FcRn portfolio, and for general corporate purposes and working capital. The company also expects that the proceeds will extend its cash runway to fund its operating plan into 2026. Jefferies, Evercore ISI, and Stifel are acting as lead placement agents for the private placement financing. LifeSci Capital LLC and Wedbush PacGrow are also acting as co-placement agents for the private placement financing. The securities being sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or any states' securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Viridian has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of the shares issued in the private placement. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Notice of Issuance of Inducement Grants Viridian also announced the grant of an inducement award to Mr. Mahoney, as well as to Mr. Beetham and to two other new employees, including Dr. Wu, in each case as an inducement material to such executive officer or employee's employment pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Mr. Mahoney was granted an option to purchase 1,259,400 shares of Viridian's common stock, Mr. Beetham was granted an option to purchase 474,400 shares of Viridian's common stock, and the other new employees were granted options to purchase an aggregate of 268,200 shares of Viridian's common stock.

The inducement awards were granted outside of the company's Amended and Restated 2016 Equity Incentive Plan but remain subject to the terms and conditions of such plan."

2023-10-30 16:57:38	FTF	Western Digital Announces Proposed $1.3B Convertible Notes Offering	"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: FTF ) (""Western Digital"") today announced a proposed offering of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028 (the ""notes""), subject to market and other conditions. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Western Digital and will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of Western Digital's wholly-owned subsidiaries from time to time guaranteeing Western Digital's 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the ""2026 Notes"") (initially, Western Digital Technologies, Inc.) or that is a guarantor or obligor with respect to certain refinancing indebtedness with respect to the 2026 Notes. Upon any conversion of the notes, Western Digital will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Western Digital's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Western Digital's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. Interest on the notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2024. The notes will mature on November 15, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, offering price and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing the offering. Western Digital intends to offer the notes in a private offering only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional investors in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). In connection with the offering, Western Digital expects to grant the initial purchasers an option to purchase, during the 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the notes are issued, up to an additional $200 million principal amount of notes. Western Digital will use the net proceeds of the notes offering (1) to pay the cost of entering into capped call transactions in connection with the offering, (2) to pay the purchase price for the refinancing through private repurchases of a portion of Western Digital's existing 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the ""Existing Convertible Notes""), (3) to repay the remaining principal amount owed on the Existing Convertible Notes on the maturity date of the Existing Convertible Notes or prior to such date through further private repurchases, and (4) after the application of the proceeds in accordance with clauses (1) – (3) (or, with respect to clause (3), if Western Digital holds the requisite amount of funds to be used in accordance with such clause), for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment or repurchase of certain of Western Digital's outstanding non-convertible debt securities through tender offers, open market or privately negotiated repurchases, redemption or otherwise or repayment of any of Western Digital's other indebtedness. Contemporaneously with the pricing of the notes in the offering, Western Digital expects to enter into one or more separate and individually negotiated transactions with one or more holders of the Existing Convertible Notes to repurchase a portion of the outstanding Existing Convertible Notes for cash on terms to be negotiated separately with each holder (each, a ""note repurchase""). The terms of each note repurchase are anticipated to be individually negotiated with each holder of the Existing Convertible Notes and will depend on several factors, including the market price of Western Digital's common stock and the trading price of the Existing Convertible Notes at the time of each such note repurchase. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the Existing Convertible Notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. Western Digital expects that counterparties that sell their Existing Convertible Notes to it as described above and that have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such Existing Convertible Notes may enter into or unwind various transactions with respect to Western Digital's common stock (including entering into derivatives with one or more of the initial purchasers in this offering or their respective affiliates) and/or purchase shares of Western Digital's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Western Digital's common stock, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, resulting in a higher effective conversion price of the notes. Western Digital cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes or Western Digital's common stock. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Western Digital also expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates and/or certain other financial institutions, as option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Western Digital's common stock initially underlying the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Western Digital's common stock upon conversion of any notes and to offset any cash payments made in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Western Digital expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, Western Digital expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to purchase shares of Western Digital's common stock and/or enter into various transactions with respect to Western Digital's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Western Digital's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various transactions with respect to Western Digital's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Western Digital's common stock or other Western Digital securities or instruments in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes or following any repurchase of notes by Western Digital in connection with any optional redemption or fundamental change and (y) are likely to do so following any repurchase of notes by Western Digital other than in connection with any optional redemption or fundamental change if Western Digital elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Western Digital's common stock or the notes. The notes, the common stock, if any, deliverable upon conversion of the notes and the related guarantee have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. They may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell the notes or any other security, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any other security in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale is not permitted. Any offer or sale will be made only by means of an offering memorandum, as applicable."

(""Aileron"") (NASDAQ: XYYG ) today announced it has acquired Lung Therapeutics, Inc. (""Lung Tx""), a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for the treatment of orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications that have no approved or limited effective treatments. Immediately following the acquisition of Lung Tx, Aileron entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of shares of Aileron's Series X non-voting convertible preferred stock (the ""Series X preferred stock"") and warrants to purchase shares of Aileron's common stock in a private placement to a group of accredited investors led by Bios Partners (""Bios""), and including Nantahala Capital, as well as additional undisclosed investors. The private placement is expected to result in gross proceeds to Aileron of approximately $18 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. Aileron intends to use the proceeds from the private placement primarily to complete the ongoing Phase 1b clinical study of LTI-03, a Caveolin-1-related peptide in development for the treatment of IPF, and for general corporate purposes. ""We are pleased to announce that after a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, we have completed the acquisition of Lung Therapeutics, which we believe represents a value-creation opportunity for Aileron's stockholders. We are thankful and appreciative of our board members, management team and employees, both past and present, along with our investors for their support and commitment,"" said Manuel Aivado, N.D., Ph.D, Chief Executive Officer of Aileron. ""Lung Therapeutics has built a promising clinical-stage pipeline for life-threatening lung conditions, and we believe in the ability of our combined companies to deliver value to both patients and stockholders."" LTI-03 is a novel, Caveolin-1-related peptide with a dual mechanism targeting both alveolar epithelial cell (""AEC"") survival as well as inhibition of profibrotic signaling, whereas approved drugs for IPF such as nintedanib and treatments in clinical development for IPF have only demonstrated a reduction of profibrotic signaling. Studies conducted by Lung Tx and by third parties have demonstrated that Caveolin-1 is a key protein in the regulation of lung fibrosis and has a decreased expression in IPF patients. Lung Tx's preclinical studies, including those of biopsied tissue from IPF patients, have demonstrated a decrease in numerous profibrotic signaling proteins, as well as the ability to protect AECs. IPF is a chronic lung disease characterized by progressive tissue scarring that prevents proper lung function. It is a progressive, fatal, age-associated lung disease affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States.i IPF typically presents in adults 65 or older and is usually fatal within two to five years after diagnosis. LTI-03 completed a Phase 1a clinical trial in healthy volunteers and is currently in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial in IPF patients. Management and Organization Aileron will be led by its current management team consisting of Manuel C. Aivado, N.D., Ph.D, Chief Executive Officer, and Susan Drexler, N.B.A., C.P.A., Interim Chief Financial Officer, as well as Brian Windsor, Ph.D, former Chief Executive Officer of Lung Tx, who was appointed as President and Chief Operating Officer of Aileron. Dr. Windsor has 23 years of experience in the formation and execution of life science companies. He was the first employee of Lung Tx and led the company from 2013 to 2023. While at Lung Tx, Dr. Windsor spun out technology to form TFF Pharmaceuticals, which listed on Nasdaq in 2019. Prior to Lung Tx, he served as President of Enavail, a specialty pharmaceutical company. Dr. Windsor received both his B.S. and Ph.D. in molecular biology from the University of Texas at Austin. ""I am thrilled to join the management team of Aileron,"" said Dr. Windsor, President and Chief Operating Officer of Aileron. ""I look forward to working with Dr. Aivado and his team to continue the development of our programs at Aileron. I want to thank the board and entire team of Lung Therapeutics for all their hard work with this transaction."" Following the transaction, Aileron's board members will include former members of the board of directors of Lung Tx, William C. Fairey and Alan A. Musso, and current Aileron board members Josef L. von Rickenbach, who will serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Manuel C. Aivado, N.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, Reinhard J. Ambros, Ph.D., and Nolan Sigal, N.D., Ph.D. About the Acquisition and Private Placement The acquisition of Lung Tx was structured as a stock-for-stock transaction whereby all of Lung Tx's outstanding equity interests were exchanged in a merger for a combination of shares of Aileron common stock and shares of Aileron Series X preferred stock. Following the acquisition, Lung Tx became a wholly owned subsidiary of Aileron. Immediately after the acquisition of Lung Tx, Aileron entered into a definitive agreement for a private placement with existing Lung Tx investors and new investors to raise approximately $18 million , including the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.6 million issued by Lung Tx to Bios prior to the acquisition. In the private placement, investors have agreed to purchase (i) an aggregate of 4,707 shares of Series X preferred stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,353,500 shares of Aileron common stock. The warrants will be exercisable any time after the later of May 2, 2024 and the date stockholder approval for the conversion rights of the Series X preferred stock is obtained and on or prior to May 2, 2027, at an exercise price of $4.89 . The private placement is expected to close on November 2, 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Subject to stockholder approval of the conversion of the Series X preferred stock into Aileron common stock, each share of Series X preferred stock will convert into 1,000 shares of Aileron common stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations initially set at, and not to exceed, 19.99%. On a pro forma basis, based upon the number of shares of Aileron common stock and Series X preferred stock issued in the acquisition and the private placement and assuming the conversion of all such Series X preferred stock to Aileron common stock, but excluding any potential exercise of warrants issued in the private placement, Aileron equity holders immediately prior to the acquisition will own approximately 14% of Aileron on an as-converted-to-common basis immediately after these transactions. The acquisition was approved by the board of directors of Aileron and the board of directors and stockholders of Lung Tx. The closing of the transactions was not subject to the approval of Aileron stockholders. Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Aileron and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is serving as legal counsel to Aileron. Cozen S'Connor P.C. is serving as legal counsel to Lung Tx. Clear Street LLC is serving as financial advisor to Lung Tx and is acting as lead placement agent for the private placement. Brookline LLC is acting as co-placement agent. Winston & Strawn LLP is serving as legal counsel to the placement agents. As of September 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis to give effect to the receipt of gross proceeds of the private placement, Aileron and Lung Tx's combined cash and cash equivalents was approximately $29 million . Based on Aileron's current operating plan, Aileron estimates that these cash resources will enable Aileron to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned into the fourth quarter of 2024. An updated corporate presentation can be found at www.aileronrx.com in the Events & Presentations section.

The U.S. Offering and the European Offering are referred to, together, as the "" Global Offering. "" The offering price of €5.07 per Ordinary Share, corresponding to the offering price of $5.36 per ADS based on an exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.0568 , is equal to the volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris ("" Euronext "") over the last three trading sessions preceding the pricing of the Global Offering (i.e. October 30, 31 and November 1, 2023), less a discount of 15% and has been determined by the Company pursuant to the 24th and 25th resolutions of the Company's combined shareholders' meeting held on June 27, 2023. Pursuant to an existing securities purchase agreement, Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc. ("" JJDC "") is obligated to subscribe, subject to any required regulatory approvals, for $25.0 million of Ordinary Shares in the form of restricted ADSs (the "" Placement Amount ""), at a price per ADS equal to the offering price in the U.S. Offering in a concurrent private placement (the "" Concurrent Private Placement ""), exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "" Securities Act ""). Pursuant to French foreign investment control rules, the Placement Amount is required to be reduced, such that JJDC will initially subscribe for 3,670,294 restricted ADSs (representing 9.99% of the outstanding voting rights of the Company's capital stock (the "" Regulatory Cap "")) for $19.7 million . Upon, and subject to, the approval of the French Ministry of Economy, JJDC will subscribe for additional restricted ADSs (corresponding to the portion of the Placement Amount in excess of the Regulatory Cap) for $5.3 million . The closing of the Global Offering is not conditioned on the closing of the Concurrent Private Placement. The aggregate gross proceeds of the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement are expected to be approximately $55 million , equivalent to approximately €51.5 million, before deduction of underwriting commissions in respect of the Global Offering and estimated expenses payable by the Company, assuming no exercise of the Over-Allotment Option (as defined below) in respect of the Global Offering. Jefferies LLC, Leerink Partners and Guggenheim are acting as global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the Global Offering. The Global Offering is subject to an underwriting agreement, which was entered into on November 2, 2023. The underwriting agreement does not constitute a performance guarantee ( garantie de bonne fin ) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). Type of Offering The 9,269,424 Ordinary Shares issued in the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement (including in the form of ADSs and in the case of JJDC, restricted ADSs) are issued without preferential subscription rights for existing shareholders by way of: a first capital increase of 5,599,130 Ordinary Shares subscribed in the Global Offering, decided on the date hereof by the Company's Executive Board pursuant to the delegation granted to it by the Company's combined shareholders' meeting held on June 27, 2023 in its 24th resolution in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) reserved to specific investors meeting the criteria defined by the shareholders' meeting in the 24th resolution – i.e., natural or legal entities (including companies), trusts and investment funds or other investment vehicles that invest on a regular basis, or have invested at least €1 million within the last 36 months, in the healthcare or biotechnology sectors; and a second capital increase of 3,670,294 Ordinary Shares (in the form of restricted ADSs) subscribed by JJDC in the Concurrent Private Placement, decided on the date hereof by the Company's Executive Board pursuant to the delegation granted to it by the Company's combined shareholders' meeting held on June 27, 2023 in its 25th resolution in accordance with Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) reserved to a specific investor meeting the criteria defined by the shareholders' meeting in the 25th resolution – i.e., an industrial company, institution or entity operating in the healthcare or biotechnology sector, either directly or through a controlled company or a company by which they are controlled, where applicable when entering into a commercial agreement, financing contract or partnership with the Company. Expected Closing The Global Offering and Concurrent Private Placement are expected to close on November 6, and November 9, 2023, respectively, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Option to Purchase Additional Shares In connection with the Global Offering, the Company has granted the underwriters for the Global Offering a 30-day option to purchase additional ADSs on the same terms and conditions as in the Global Offering, in accordance with delegation granted by the Company's combined shareholders' meeting held on June 27, 2023 in its 26th resolution (the "" Over-Allotment Option ""). The Company will announce the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option and the number ADSs to be issued in connection therewith, if any, as soon as practicable thereafter in a subsequent press release. Stabilization In connection with the Global Offering, Jefferies LLC, acting as stabilization agent, may effect transactions with a view to supporting, stabilizing, or maintaining the market price of such securities at a level higher than which might otherwise prevail in the Company's ADS market. However, there is no assurance that the stabilization agent will take any stabilization action and, if begun, such stabilization action may be ended at any time without prior notice. Any stabilization action or over-allotment shall be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and may be undertaken on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Estimated Proceeds from the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement The aggregate gross proceeds from the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement are expected to be approximately $55 million , equivalent to approximately €51.5 million, before deducting underwriting commissions in respect of the Global Offering and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, assuming no exercise of the Over-Allotment Option in connection with the Global Offering. If the Company issues additional ADSs pursuant to the exercise in full of the Over-Allotment Option in connection with the Global Offering, the estimated gross proceeds received by the Company from the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement would be expected to be approximately $59.5 million , equivalent to approximately €56.3 million, before deducting underwriting commissions in respect of the Global Offering and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering, together with the proceeds from the Concurrent Private Placement, as follows: approximately 32% of the net proceeds to advance the Company's NANORAY-312 global randomized Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and the EU for the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancers, and approximately 17% of the proceeds for the related increase of production capacity and supply of NBTXR3 required for this study; approximately 27% to advance the research and development of the Company's other preclinical and clinical programs and related regulatory and medical activities; and approximately 24% to other operating expenses funding and other general corporate purposes, including financing expenses (including a payment to the EIB). The expected use of proceeds represents the Company's intentions based upon its current plans and business conditions. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of Global Offering and Concurrent Private Placement or the amounts that the Company will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of the Company's actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of the development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials the Company may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations that the Company may enter into with third parties for its product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, the Company's management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €38.7 million (unaudited). The Company believes that the net proceeds from the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement, together with its cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for operations until the end of the first quarter 2025, and, assuming the receipt from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (‘‘Janssen'') of the first milestone payment under the Company's License Agreement with Janssen dated July 7, 2023, until the end of the second quarter 2025. The Company's estimates of the period of time through which its financial resources are expected to be adequate to meet its working capital requirements are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors, as described under ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Lock-up In connection with the Global Offering, the Company's executive board members and supervisory board members are subject to a contractual lock-up for a period of 90 days after the date hereof, subject to customary exceptions, including an exception for the purpose of financing the exercise price of stock options and/or satisfying any applicable taxes due in connection with such exercise. The Company has also agreed to be bound by a contractual lock-up for a period of 90 days after the date hereof, subject to customary exceptions. Dilution The 9,269,424Ordinary Shares (including in the form of ADSs) issued in the Global Offering, to be mainly subscribed by existing investors, and in the Concurrent Private Placement will represent dilution of approximately 20.4% of the share capital of the Company (on a non-diluted basis) (21.8%, if the Over-Allotment is exercised in full). On an illustrative basis, a shareholder holding 1% of Nanobiotix' share capital before the Global Offering and Concurrent Private Placement would hold a stake of 0.83% after completion of the Global Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement (0.82%% if the Over-Allotment is exercised in full). Certain entities affiliated with Invus Public Equities Advisors, LLC, Baillie Gifford & Co and Qatar Holding LLC, existing shareholders of the Company not represented at its supervisory board, have agreed to purchase an aggregate of approximately 94% of the total number of Ordinary Shares (including in the form of ADSs) to be sold in the Global Offering. Risk Factors Potential investors should carefully consider the risks described under ""Risk Factors"" in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, including the following risks: shareholders not participating in the Global Offering and Concurrent Private Placement may see their participation in the Company's share capital diluted due to the issuance of new securities; the volatility and liquidity of the Company's Ordinary Shares and ADSs may experience significant fluctuation (mainly downwards), and there may be differences on Nasdaq and Euronext; and sales of the Company's Ordinary Shares and ADSs, in particular by its significant shareholders, could occur on the market and have an adverse impact on the Company's trading prices. Settlement and Delivery – Documentation The Company's ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "" FCVN "". The Company's Ordinary Shares are listed on Euronext under the symbol ""NANO.""

However, contribution per patron was up about 30% versus 2019. ZUS ended the quarter with $729.7 million in cash and equivalents. &quot;The short-term impacts of the Writer's and Actor's strikes will cause additional and needless challenges for ZUS in 2024 ... There has been and will be much collateral damage from these lengthy work stoppages,&quot; Aron added.

(NASDAQ: RMFD ) (""Merit""), a leading global manufacturer and marketer of healthcare technology, announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the ""notes"") in a private placement (the ""offering"") only to persons reasonably believed to be ""qualified institutional buyers"" pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). Merit also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, during a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $82.5 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Merit and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears. Upon conversion, Merit will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Merit's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Merit's common stock, at Merit's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Merit's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. Merit intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Merit expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties (as defined below). Merit intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment or reduction of existing debt, sales and marketing activities, medical affairs and educational efforts, research and development, clinical studies, working capital, capital expenditures and investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies in the future. However, while Merit regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities, Merit has no commitments with respect to any acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies of a material nature at this time. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Merit expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates (the ""option counterparties""). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Merit's common stock initially underlying the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Merit's common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments Merit is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, Merit expects the option counterparties or their respective affiliates to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Merit's common stock and/or purchase shares of Merit's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Merit's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Merit's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Merit's common stock or other securities of Merit in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the capped call transactions or following any termination of any portion of the capped call transactions in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Merit's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of a holder of notes to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following a conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that a holder of notes will receive upon conversion of its notes. The notes and any shares of Merit's common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. The notes will be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act."
