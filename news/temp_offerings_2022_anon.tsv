2022-01-04 16:14:33	FUG	Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Announces Public Offering Of 6,500,000 Shares Of Common Stock In Connection With Forward Sale Agreements	Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (&quot;Alexandria&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) (NYSE: FUG ) today announced that it is commencing an underwritten public offering of 6,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to market conditions, in connection with the forward sale agreements described below. The Company expects to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 975,000 additional shares. J.P. Morgan, BofA Securities, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and RBC Capital Markets are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. The Company expects to enter into forward sale agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Royal Bank of Canada (the &quot;forward purchasers&quot;) with respect to 6,500,000 shares of its common stock (and expects to enter into forward sale agreements with respect to an aggregate of 7,475,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers or their affiliates are expected to borrow and sell to the underwriters an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares of the common stock that will be delivered in this offering (or an aggregate of 7,475,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, which right is subject to certain conditions, the Company intends to deliver, upon physical settlement of such forward sale agreements on one or more dates specified by the Company occurring no later than September 15, 2023, an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 7,475,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) to the forward purchasers in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price, which will be the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreements. The Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchasers or their affiliates in the offering. The Company expects to use the net proceeds, if any, it receives upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreements to fund pending acquisitions and the construction of highly leased development and redevelopment projects, with remaining proceeds, if any, to be used for general working capital and other corporate purposes, which may include the reduction of the outstanding balance, if any, on the Company's unsecured senior line of credit and the outstanding indebtedness, if any, under the Company's commercial paper program. Selling common stock through the forward sale agreements enables the Company to set the price of such shares upon the pricing of the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company until the expected funding is required. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

2022-01-13 07:41:37	NHKB	Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. Announces Proposed $425M Convertible Senior Notes Offering	Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NHKB ) (&quot;Virgin Galactic&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $425 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2027 (the &quot;notes&quot;) in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Securities Act&quot;). Virgin Galactic also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date when the notes are first issued, up to an additional $75 million principal amount of notes. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Virgin Galactic, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2022. The notes will mature on February 1, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to November 1, 2026, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. On and after November 1, 2026, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Virgin Galactic will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &quot;common stock&quot;), at its election, based on the conversion rate. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at Virgin Galactic's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2025 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Virgin Galactic's common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time and certain liquidity conditions have been satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the pricing of the offering. If a &quot;fundamental change&quot; (as will be defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Virgin Galactic to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund working capital, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures to accelerate the development of its spacecraft fleet in order to facilitate high-volume commercial service. Virgin Galactic also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, then Virgin Galactic intends to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions as described below. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Virgin Galactic expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions, which may include one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the &quot;option counterparties&quot;). The capped call transactions are expected to cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Virgin Galactic's common stock that will initially underlie the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Virgin Galactic expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Virgin Galactic's common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Virgin Galactic is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, upon conversion of the notes, up to a cap price. If, however, the market price per share of Virgin Galactic's common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. Virgin Galactic has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Virgin Galactic's common stock and/or purchase shares of Virgin Galactic's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Virgin Galactic's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Virgin Galactic's common stock and/or purchasing or selling Virgin Galactic's common stock or other securities in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the notes, any repurchase of the notes by Virgin Galactic on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the notes are retired by Virgin Galactic, in each case, if Virgin Galactic exercises the relevant election to terminate the corresponding portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or decrease in the market price of Virgin Galactic's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.

Moeller adds that the company has a spaceship platform that has already demonstrated the capability to transport humans into space. Separately, Virgin Galactic priced its offering of $425 million of 2.50% convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private offering.

2022-06-07 17:01:55	AIOF	Broadway Issues $150M Of Preferred Stock To The U.S. Department Of The Treasury Under The Emergency Capital Investment Program	Broadway Issues $150 million of Preferred Stock to the U.S. Department of the Treasury Under the Emergency Capital Investment Program Broadway Financial Corporation (&quot;Broadway&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) (NASDAQ Capital Market: AIOF), announced that the Company completed a private placement of $150 million of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the &quot;Preferred Stock&quot;), to the United States Department of the Treasury (the &quot;U.S. Treasury&quot;) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (&quot;ECIP&quot;). The ECIP investment by the U.S. Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions to provide funding for these institutions to increase access to capital for small and minority-owned businesses and consumers in traditionally underserved markets, such as low-to-moderate income communities, that may have been disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate that is dependent on Broadway's investment of the proceeds within Target Communities in certain types of loans that are consistent with the types of loans that the Company has historically originated. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. The dividend rate after the initial two years will be reset annually until the tenth anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred Stock and will be based upon the annual change in actual qualified lending relative to a baseline level of qualified lending, expressed as a percentage of the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Stock. The final reset will be based upon the average annual increase in qualified lending over the nine-year period preceding the last reset date, expressed as a percentage of the aggregate liquidation amount. The Preferred Stock has an aggregate liquidation amount of $150 million and is redeemable in whole, or in part, at the option of the Company on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, subject to certain limitations and exceptions as set forth in the Certificate of Designations for the Preferred Stock. The investment by the U.S. Treasury is intended to qualify as Tier 1 Capital. At March 31, 2022, Broadway's stockholders' equity was $136.2 million, or 12.04% of the Company's assets, and the Tier 1 Capital of its bank subsidiary, City First Bank, National Association, was $99.9 million. The issuance of the Preferred Stock will not impact Broadway's book value per common share. Chief Executive Officer, Brian Argrett, commented, &quot;We are excited to report that we have raised $150 million of gross proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury, which is more than we originally reported when the U.S. Treasury announced that Broadway's application for ECIP capital was accepted. The investment will more than double our Tier 1 Capital and allow us to greatly enhance the scale of Broadway's operations and improve the economics of the Company's business. In addition, this equity capital will significantly improve our ability to advance our mission and multiply the impact that we can make in the low-to-moderate income communities that we serve. Over time, the proceeds from this equity investment should allow us to more than double the size of Broadway's loan portfolio.&quot; Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as legal advisor to the Company. Additional information regarding the Preferred Stock will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K that the Company will file within the next few days. About CityFirstBroadway Broadway Financial Corporation conducts its operations through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, City First Bank, National Association, which is a leading community-oriented bank in Southern California and in the Washington, D.C. market serving low-to-moderate income communities. We offer a variety of residential and commercial real estate loan products for consumers, businesses, and non-profit organizations, other loan products, and a variety of deposit products, including checking, savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and retirement accounts.

2022-08-15 07:23:47	YVRR	Halozyme Announced Up to $200M Buyback of Shares in Parallel With Offering of $500M of Convertible Senior Notes	"Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: YVRR ) (""Halozyme"" or the ""Company""), a leader in converting IV biologics to subcutaneous delivery and autoinjector devices, today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $500 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2028 (the ""Convertible Notes""). The Convertible Notes are to be offered and sold to ""qualified institutional buyers"" pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The Company also expects to grant a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears. The Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2028, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after February 15, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions in cash and, if applicable, shares of the Company's common stock. The initial conversion rate, interest rate and other terms of the Convertible Notes will be determined at the time of pricing in negotiations with the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes. In connection with the offering, the Company intends to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with option counterparties that may include one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates and/or other institutions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company may enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. The Company has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties and/or their affiliates (i) expect to purchase shares of the Company's common stock and/or enter into derivative transactions with respect to the Company's common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Convertible Notes and (ii) may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivative transactions with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company's common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing, or preventing a decline in, the market price of the Company's common stock concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the Convertible Notes. The effect, if any, of these activities, including the direction or magnitude, on the market price of the Company's common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock. The Company expects to use a portion of net proceeds of the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions. The Company also expects to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to enter into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of its outstanding 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the ""Existing Convertible Notes"") to exchange their Existing Convertible Notes for a combination of cash and shares of its common stock through privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the proposed offering (the ""Note Repurchases""). In parallel to this transaction, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering for the repurchase of shares of its common stock (the ""Share Repurchases"") up to $200 million, concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the offering in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, which may be effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or any affiliate thereof. The Share Repurchases, if consummated in full, would represent an increase of $100 million of the previously planned share repurchases to be made in 2022 under the Company's ongoing three-year $750 million share repurchase program, which was commenced and previously announced in 2021. Further, the Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay all of its outstanding $250 million term loan facility due 2026. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including other repurchases of the Company's common stock from time to time under the existing stock repurchase program, working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional notes to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions. The Note Repurchases and Share Repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Halozyme common stock or the Convertible Notes. We also expect that some existing noteholders may purchase or sell shares of the Company's common stock in the market to hedge their exposure in connection with these transactions. The Note Repurchases, Share Repurchases and any associated hedging by holders could affect the market price of the Company's common stock prior to, concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes and could also result in a higher effective conversion price for the Convertible Notes."

2022-09-07 16:58:42	P	Wayfair Announces Proposed Offering Of $600 million Convertible Senior Notes	Wayfair Inc. (NYSE: P ) (the &quot;Company,&quot; &quot;we&quot; or &quot;Wayfair&quot;) announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $600 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2027 (the &quot;notes&quot;) in a private offering (the &quot;offering&quot;) to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Securities Act&quot;). In connection with the offering, the Company expects to grant the initial purchasers an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the initial issuance date of the notes, up to an additional $90 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The final terms of the notes, including the initial conversion rate, interest rate and certain other terms, will be determined at the time of pricing. The Company expects that the reference price used to calculate the initial conversion price for the notes will be the last reported sale price of the Company's Class A common stock on Thursday, September 8, 2022. The notes will bear interest semi-annually and will mature on September 15, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. Prior to June 15, 2027, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods. Thereafter, the notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Company may not redeem the notes prior to September 20, 2025. On or after September 20, 2025, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the notes if the last reported sale price of the Company's Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including at least one of the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The notes will be convertible at the option of holders, subject to certain conditions and during certain periods, into cash, shares of the Company's Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's Class A common stock, with the form of consideration determined at the Company's election. Holders of the notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain events. When issued, the notes will be the Company's senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company's existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, such as its 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2022, 1.125% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the &quot;2024 Notes&quot;), 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the &quot;2025 Notes&quot;), 2.50% accreting convertible senior notes due 2025 (the &quot;Accreting 2025 Notes&quot;) and 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2026; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company's subsidiaries, including Wayfair LLC's guarantee of the Accreting 2025 Notes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or certain other financial institutions (the &quot;option counterparties&quot;). These capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Company's Class A common stock upon any conversion of notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction of potential dilution and/or offset of cash payments subject to a cap.

The Bellevue, Washington-based company, which completed a $26-billion merger with Sprint in 2020, has increased its free cash flow position to $1.8 billion as of the second quarter of 2022. F-Mobile was previously at $690 million in free cash flow in December 2015, per Macrotrends . F-Mobile&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents in the first half of 2022 are $6.4 billion, and were $6.6 billion in 2021. As F-Mobile records some of its highest revenues in the past ten years and increases its free cash flow position, it has opened the door for hefty buybacks, as a way to distribute its profits back to shareholders. See Also: F-Mobile To Launch Travel Service For Users Unfortunately, F-Mobile has not paid a dividend since Sept. 1, 2015, where it was paying a dividend yield of 6.81% or $2.75 per share annually.

Due to the merger with Sprint , and F-Mobile&rsquo;s current debt positions, it is no mystery why the company is holding off dividend payments until further notice.

Subjects challenged with a higher 21 mg oral THC dose and treated with a placebo showed greater central nervous system (CNS) effects than observed in Part A with 10.5 mg THC. The effects included a substantial increase in feeling high and body sway, decreased alertness, and slightly increased heart rate. Subjects treated with 10 mg or 30 mg DILS-001 led to significant and sustained reductions in the visual analog scale (VAS) feeling high score, improvement in the VAS alertness scale and a reduction in THC-induced body sway compared to placebo. 100% of subjects given 21 mg THC with placebo met the VAS threshold for feeling high compared to only one subject per group treated with DILS-001 at 10 mg or 30 mg doses. Although the THC-induced increase in heart rate in this study was small, there was a trend towards improvement with DILS-001 compared to placebo. The 10 mg and 30 mg DILS-001 doses had similar effects to previous higher doses used in Part A, despite doubling the THC dose. Anebulo also announced a private placement of 2.26 million shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 2.26 million for $2.935. The warrants have an exercise price of $4.215 per share.

Our shares of Common Stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol &ldquo;BWNY&rdquo;. On October 27, 2022, the last reported sale price of our shares of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $0.45 per share. We are also offering on a &ldquo;reasonable best efforts&rdquo; basis pre-funded warrants, or &ldquo;Pre-Funded Warrants,&rdquo; to purchase up to shares of Common Stock. We are offering to certain purchasers whose purchase of Common Stock in this offering would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately following the consummation of this offering, the opportunity to purchase, if any purchaser so chooses, Pre-Funded Warrants, in lieu of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise result in such purchaser&rsquo;s beneficial ownership exceeding 4.99% (or, at the election of the purchaser, 9.99%) of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. The purchase price of each Pre-Funded Warrant is $ (which is equal to the assumed public offering price per share of Common Stock to be sold in this offering minus $0.0001, the exercise price per share of Common Stock of each Pre-Funded Warrant). The Pre-Funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. For each Pre-Funded Warrant we sell, the number of shares of Common Stock we are offering will be decreased on a one-for-one basis. Our shares of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants are being offered together with warrants, or &ldquo;Common Warrants,&rdquo; to purchase up to shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrant will be sold together with one Common Warrant. Each Common Warrant has an exercise price of $ per share (representing % of the assumed public offering price per share of Common Stock to be sold in this offering) and will expire on the anniversary of the original issuance date. Because we will issue a Common Warrant for each share of Common Stock and for each Pre-Funded Warrant sold in this offering, the number of Common Warrants sold in this offering will not change as a result of a change in the mix of shares of Common Stock and Pre-Funded Warrants sold.

2022-12-20 16:15:17	SRQA	Genius Sports Limited Announces Filing Of Amended Registration Statement On Form F-4 Regarding Certain Amendments To Its Previously Announced Warrant Consent Solicitation	Genius Sports Limited (NYSE: SRQA ) (&quot;Genius&quot; or the &quot;Company&quot;) today announced that it has filed an amended Registration Statement on Form F-4 regarding the amended terms of its previously announced solicitation of consents (the &quot;Consent Solicitation&quot;) to amend certain terms and mechanics related to exercises of warrants in connection with the Consent Solicitation (the &quot;Warrant Amendment&quot;). As previously announced on December 16, 2022, the Company extended the Expiration Date from 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 16, 2022 until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 19, 2023. Consistent with the previous announcement, holders of the Company's warrants will continue to have the ability to exercise on a cashless basis for 0.26 shares per warrant until the Expiration Date. Subject to approval of the Warrant Amendment by holders of the Company's warrants, any warrants not exercised on or prior to the Expiration Date will be automatically exercised on a cashless basis for an effective delivery of 0.234 ordinary shares per warrant, which is 10% less than the number of shares per warrant to be received by the holders who elect to exercise on a cashless basis on or prior to the Expiration Date. The Company's ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols &quot;SRQA&quot; and &quot;SRQA WS,&quot; respectively. As of December 16, 2022, a total of 7,668,280 warrants were outstanding. If approved by holders of at least the 50% of the outstanding warrants, the Warrant Amendment would ensure that there would be no warrants outstanding after January 20, 2023. The purpose of the Consent Solicitation is to simplify the Company's capital structure and reduce the potential dilutive impact of the warrants, thereby providing the Company with greater financial flexibility and providing investors and prospective investors with greater certainty as to the Company's capital structure. Amended Mechanics Relating to Exercises in Connection with the Consent Solicitation If the Consent Solicitation is approved, the exercise price of the warrants will be 74% of the 1-day VWAP of the Company's ordinary shares on the second trading day prior to the Expiration Date, which is expected to be January 17, 2023 (such day, the &quot;Reference Period&quot;, and such price the &quot;Reduced Exercise Price&quot;). Holders who exercise warrants on or before the Expiration Date can do so on either a cashless basis in order to receive 0.26 ordinary shares per warrant, or by paying cash for the Reduced Exercise Price to receive one ordinary share per warrant. By delivering consents in the Consent Solicitation, holders will be exercising their warrants at the Reduced Exercise Price, and by exercising their warrants, holders will be consenting to the Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation. If the Warrant Amendment is Approved Approval of the Warrant Amendment requires the consent of at least 50% of the holders of the Company's warrants. If the Warrant Amendment is approved, any warrant that is not exercised on or prior to the Expiration Date will be exercised automatically on a cashless basis on the first trading day following the Expiration Date, at an exercise price that is 76.6% of 1-day VWAP of the Company's ordinary shares for the Reference Period, resulting in such holders receiving 0.234 ordinary shares per warrant, which is 10% less than the number of ordinary shares per warrant to be received by holders that exercise on a cashless basis at the Reduced Exercise Price on or prior to the Expiration Date. If the Warrant Amendment is Not Approved If the Warrant Amendment is not approved and such condition is not waived, the warrants will retain their current terms and any exercises of warrants by holders at the Reduced Exercise Price will not be consummated and holders will be returned their warrants. The warrants currently have an exercise price of $11.50 per ordinary share and expire on April 20, 2026, subject to certain terms and conditions. The Company has engaged BofA Securities, Inc. as solicitation agent. D.F. King & Co., Inc. has been appointed as the information and tabulation agent for the Consent Solicitation and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the Company's transfer agent. Requests for documents should be directed to D.F. King & Co., Inc. at (800) 370-1749 (for warrant holders) or (212) 269-5550 (for banks and brokers) or via the following email address: geniussports@dfking.com . Important Additional Information has been Filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission In connection with the Consent Solicitation, the Company has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission an amended registration statement on Form F-4/A and an amendment to its tender offer statement on Schedule TO. The registration statement has not yet become effective. Securities may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time that the registration statement becomes effective. This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell the warrants or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any ordinary shares in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful before registration or qualification under the laws of any such state. The Consent Solicitation is being made only through the Schedule TO and prospectus and the complete terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation are set forth in the Schedule TO and prospectus. Copies of the Schedule TO and prospectus will be available free of charge at the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov . Requests for documents may also be directed to D.F. King & Co., Inc. at the phone number and email address set forth above. Holders of the warrants are urged to read the Schedule TO and prospectus carefully before making any decision with respect to the Consent Solicitation because they contain important information, including the various terms of, and conditions to, the Consent Solicitation. None of the Company, any of its management or its board of directors, or the solicitation agent, the transfer agent or the information and tabulation agent makes any recommendation as to whether or not holders of warrants should consent to the Warrant Amendment in the Consent Solicitation.

Petrie Partners Securities, LLC acted as sole placement agent on a portion of the transaction. Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, &quot;This equity capital raise will allow us to continue to advance our 30% interest in the Peak Gold, LLC joint venture (PGJV) while we arrange debt financing to fund the remaining balance of funds necessary to place the Manh Choh project into production. Kinross, the manager, operator and 70% owner of the PGJV has communicated at our last joint venture meeting that the project remains on schedule and on budget. The Camp facilities located in Tok, Alaska are nearing completion and construction work will continue through the winter months on the development of the Manh Choh project site to ensure that the project remains on schedule for first gold production in the second half of 2024. I am also happy to report that the project is approaching 50% contracted/committed and is trending on budget &ndash; meaning that work is being completed and major contracts are under negotiation for the contract mining and completed as to the contract ore hauling segments of the project which collectively make up over 50% of project development and operating costs. Since Contango discovered this high-quality ore deposit in 2011, we have worked closely with the Tetlin Tribal Council and now most recently with Kinross to place the project into production. We are excited to see this project come to fruition. Despite the difficult market conditions and current inflationary environment, we are getting it done. Based on a feasibility study completed by Kinross1, the Manh Choh project is expected to produce approximately 225,000 ounces of VZP/year (67,500 for LSET's 30% interest). The Company expects to complete a SK 1300 compliant technical report once a final Toll Milling Agreement between the Company and Kinross Fort Knox is signed. Meanwhile, after completing 29 exploration drill holes, we have ceased exploration drilling activities on our Lucky Shot project in preparation for the winter months. All 29 holes intersected the Lucky Shot vein structure. We engaged a third-party structural geologist from Oriented Targeted Solutions Inc. to complete a structural analysis of the vein structure based on underground mapping and drill core logging. We expect to receive all assays for this year's exploration effort by the end of January and then complete a SK1300 Resource Estimate Technical report by the end of calendar Q1 2023. We look forward to continuing to update our shareholders and investors on our progress at both our Manh Choh and Lucky Shot projects. Management believes that 2023 will be pivotal year for the company with mining activities commencing at Manh Choh and an initial resource estimate at Lucky Shot.&quot;
