2024-01-04 09:08:23	WHF	Reported Jan 3, 2024, OPKO Health, Inc. Announced That It Is Commencing A Private Offering Of $200M Aggregate Principal Amount Of Its Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029	"OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: WHF ) (the ""Company"") today announced that it is commencing a private offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the ""Notes""). The Company also expects to grant the initial purchaser in the offering an option to purchase, within the 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes are first issued, up to an additional $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company, are expected to pay interest semiannually and will mature on January 15, 2029, unless earlier purchased or converted in accordance with their terms. Holders of the Notes will have the right to convert their Notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. Conversions of the Notes will be settled in cash, shares of the Company's common stock (""common stock"") or a combination of thereof, at the Company's election. However, before the Company has available and has reserved the maximum number of shares of the common stock issuable under the Notes, the Company will be required to elect to deliver solely cash or, subject to certain limitations, a combination of cash and shares of the common stock upon conversion. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the pricing of the Notes. Certain entities affiliated with Phillip Frost, N.D., the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jane L. Hsiao, Ph.D., MBA, the Company's Vice-Chairman and Chief Technical Officer, as well as additional existing holders, have indicated an interest in acquiring, in a concurrent private placement, approximately $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the ""Affiliate Notes"") in exchange for approximately $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's existing 5% convertible promissory notes, inclusive of approximately $5.0 million of accrued but unpaid interest thereon, held by such persons. The Company expects the Affiliate Notes to constitute part of the same series as the Notes. However, if issued, the Affiliate Notes will not initially be fungible with the Notes and will be subject to different transfer restrictions than the Notes. The offering of the Notes is not conditioned upon the closing of the concurrent private placement of Affiliate Notes, but such private placement is conditioned upon the closing of the offering of the Notes. The foregoing persons' indication of interest is not a binding agreement or commitment to acquire the Affiliate Notes or any other securities. The Company expects to use up to $50.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, and, if needed, cash on hand, to repurchase shares of the common stock from purchasers of Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through the initial purchaser or its affiliate. These repurchases could increase, or prevent a decrease in, the market price of the common stock or the Notes concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the Notes. Also, contemporaneously with the pricing of the Notes, the Company expects to enter into separate, privately negotiated transactions with one or more holders of the Company's outstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""2025 Convertible Senior Notes"") to repurchase a portion of such notes. The Company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, and, if needed, cash on hand, to consummate such repurchases. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase, redeem or otherwise retire additional 2025 Convertible Senior Notes. The terms of the foregoing note repurchases are anticipated to be individually negotiated with one or more holders of the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes and will depend on several factors, including the market price of the common stock and the trading price of the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes at the time of each such repurchase. Such repurchases are not conditioned upon the completion of the offering of the Notes, nor is the completion of the offering of the Notes conditioned upon such repurchases. No assurance can be given as to how much, if any, of the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes will be repurchased or the terms on which they will be repurchased. The Company intends to use any net proceeds from the offering of the Notes that remain following the foregoing common stock and note repurchases for general corporate purposes. Any repurchase of the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes, and the potential related market activities by holders of the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes participating in the foregoing note repurchases or as a result of the unwind of their derivative transactions with respect to the common stock, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the common stock, which may affect the trading price of the Notes at that time and may result in a higher effective conversion price of the Notes. The Company cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the Notes or the common stock. The Notes and any shares of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), or any other securities laws, and the Notes and any common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. The Notes are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. This press release does not constitute an offer to purchase, or notice of redemption, with respect to the 2025 Convertible Senior Notes, and the Company reserves the right to elect not to proceed with the note repurchases described above. This press release does not constitute an offer to repurchase shares of common stock, and the Company reserves the right to elect not to proceed with the common stock repurchases described above."

Looking at Sidus Space, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Sidus Space, the 200-day moving average sits at $15.16, according to Benzinga Pro , which is above the current price of $4.77. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here . Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal.

(NASDAQ: CGJW ) (""Vaccinex"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a differentiated approach to treating neurodegenerative disease by blocking astrogliosis and neuroinflammation through the inhibition of SEMA4D, today announced it has priced a $3.7 million private placement transaction with a lead investment from a major new investor alongside significant participation from existing investors, including entities affiliated with the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors and the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The securities purchase agreement for the financing provides for the sale of an aggregate of 3,838,544 shares of the Company's common stock (and 1,265,078 common stock equivalents in lieu of common stock) together with common warrants to purchase up to an equal number (5,103,622) of shares of common stock. The shares and warrants are being sold at a combined purchase price per share and warrant of $0.725. The common warrants will have an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The common warrants will be immediately exercisable and will expire five years from the initial exercise date, provided, however, that the Company may call the warrants within 120 days after reporting specified positive topline data in the Company's ongoing SIGNAL-AD phase 1/2a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate, pepinemab, in Alzheimer's disease. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or before February 8, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be $3.7 million. The Company believes that together with the proceeds from its previously concluded public offering of $9.6 million in October 2023, the net proceeds from this financing together with other commitments will fully fund its ongoing SIGNAL-AD trial through the release of topline data, which is anticipated in the third quarter of 2024. In connection with the private placement, the Company is also entering into a registration rights agreement with certain of the private placement investors. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, Vaccinex will agree to, among other things, file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement covering the resale of the shares covered by the registration rights agreement. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. About Pepinemab and Alzheimer's Disease Vaccinex, Inc. is pioneering a differentiated approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases and cancer through the inhibition of semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D). The Company's lead drug candidate, pepinemab, a SEMA4D blocking antibody, inhibits damaging inflammation and loss of homeostatic functions in brain of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and promotes effective tumor immunity in multiple cancers. Pepinemab is being studied as a monotherapy in the SIGNAL-AD Phase 1/2a clinical trial in Alzheimer's Disease (""AD""), with ongoing exploration of potential Phase 3 development in Huntington's disease (""HD""). Vaccinex has previously reported results of a phase 2 trial in HD (Nature Medicine 28:2183-2193 (2022)) that indicated pepinemab treatment prevents decline in glucose uptake associated with astrocyte activation and significantly slows cognitive decline as measured by the HD Cognitive Assessment Battery (HD-CAB). Astrocytes are key regulatory cells in the brain that, under conditions of injury or disease, switch from their normal supportive physiological functions to inflammatory activity that is believed to aggravate damage to brain tissue. This transition is marked by release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (""GFAP""), a characteristic astrocyte product, into blood. GFAP level in blood has been found to correlate with Aβ amyloid deposits in brain and to be associated with higher risk of incident dementia and faster rates of cognitive decline in AD. A committee convened by the Alzheimer's Association has recently recommended GFAP as a leading blood-based biomarker of astrocyte activation and brain inflammation in AD. Vaccinex recently reported that pepinemab treatment significantly reduces GFAP levels in blood of patients with HD. Given the many physiological parallels between neurodegenerative processes in HD and AD, we believe that similar biological effects of pepinemab treatment are likely in the two indications. Early evidence of limited benefit to AD patients treated with antibodies to Aβ amyloid has stimulated a search for differentiated treatments, such as targeting neuroinflammation, that could further improve responses. It has been known for some time that beta amyloid deposits can also be present in the brain of elderly subjects who do not progress to Alzheimer's. As noted by Howard Fillit, MD, Chief Science Officer for the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, ""If there's no strong immune reaction to the buildup [of amyloid deposits], there's no inflammation and no progression of disease."" We believe that the ability to prevent astrocyte activation and reduce brain inflammation makes pepinemab an attractive alternative or complement to anti-Aβ antibodies with potential for greater efficacy. SIGNAL-AD is supported in part by funding from the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation."

The Company also expects to grant a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after September 1, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock at the Company's election. The initial conversion rate, interest rate and other terms of the Convertible Notes will be determined at the time of pricing in negotiations with the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes. In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more financial institutions which may include one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the ""option counterparties""). If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company's common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company's common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of the Convertible Notes by the Company to the extent the Company elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company's common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect noteholders' ability to convert the Convertible Notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. The Company expects to use a portion of net proceeds of the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund working capital for growth and business expansion. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional Convertible Notes to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions. This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes or the shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offer of these securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The offer and sale of the Convertible Notes and the shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements."
2024-02-21 17:39:28	FWC	Parsons Announces Offering Of $700M Of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029	"Parsons Corporation (NYSE: FWC ) announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the ""notes"") in a private placement. Parsons also expects to grant the initial purchasers in the offering an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Parsons. The notes will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Prior to October 1, 2028, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events, and thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, the notes will settle for cash and, if applicable, shares of Parsons' common stock. Parsons may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at its option, on or after March 8, 2027 and before the 51st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Parsons' common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes will be determined at the pricing of the offering. Parsons intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. Additionally, Parsons expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a portion of its outstanding 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""Existing Convertible Notes"") concurrently with and/or shortly after the pricing of the offering in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate. Parsons intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to, potential acquisitions and working capital. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Parsons expects to use a portion of the additional net proceeds to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions as described below. Any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including but not limited to, potential acquisitions and working capital. Parsons expects that some or all of the holders of the Existing Convertible Notes that are repurchased in the concurrent repurchases described above may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Parsons' common stock or purchase shares of Parsons' common stock in open market transactions to unwind hedge positions they may have with respect to their investment in the Existing Convertible Notes concurrently with and/or shortly after the pricing of the offering. These transactions may place upward pressure on the trading price of Parsons' common stock, causing the common stock to trade at higher prices than would be the case in the absence of these transactions, which could increase the initial conversion price of the notes. In connection with issuing the Existing Convertible Notes, Parsons entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the ""existing convertible note hedge transactions"") and warrant transactions (the ""existing warrant transactions,"" and, together with the existing convertible note hedge transactions, the ""existing call spread transactions"") with certain financial institutions (the ""existing option counterparties""). If Parsons repurchases any of its Existing Convertible Notes, then Parsons intends to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of this offering to terminate a portion of the existing convertible note hedge transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of Existing Convertible Notes repurchased. In addition, Parsons intends to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of this offering to terminate a portion of the existing warrant transactions with respect to a number of shares equal to the notional shares underlying such Existing Convertible Notes repurchased. In connection with such terminations and the related unwinding of the existing hedge position of the existing option counterparties with respect to such transactions, Parsons expects such existing option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may purchase or sell shares of Parsons' common stock in the open market and/or enter into or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to Parsons' common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could affect the market price of Parsons' common stock and the initial conversion price of the notes. The repurchases of the Existing Convertible Notes and the unwind of the existing call spread transactions described above, and the potential related market activities by holders of the Existing Convertible Notes participating in the repurchases of the Existing Convertible Notes and the existing option counterparties, as applicable, could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Parsons' common stock, which may affect the trading price of the notes offered hereby at that time and the initial conversion price of the notes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Parsons expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or certain other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The capped call transactions are expected to initially cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Parsons' common stock that will underlie the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Parsons expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Parsons' common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or at its election (subject to certain conditions) offset any potential cash payments Parsons is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of Parsons' common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price per share exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Parsons' common stock and/or purchase shares of Parsons' common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price per share of Parsons' common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Parsons' common stock and/or purchasing or selling Parsons' common stock or other securities of Parsons in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and (x) are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes and (y) are likely to do so following any repurchase of notes by Parsons if Parsons elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price per share of Parsons' common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability to convert the notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of notes, it could affect the number of shares of Parsons' common stock and/or value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The offer and sale of the notes and any shares of Parsons' common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and are not expected to be registered under the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, the notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction."

2024-02-26 16:06:31	PCNZ	Five9 Announces Proposed $600M Convertible Notes Offering	"Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCNZ ), the Intelligent CX Platform provider, today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $600 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the ""notes"") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Act""). Five9 also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $90 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Five9, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Five9's common stock (""common stock""), or a combination thereof, at Five9's election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. The notes will also be redeemable at the option of Five9 after a specified date if certain conditions are met. Five9 expects to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below and to repurchase a portion of its outstanding 0.500% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the ""2025 notes"") (such transactions, the ""2025 note repurchases""). The remainder of the net proceeds from the offering would be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The terms of any 2025 note repurchases will depend on factors, including the trading price of the 2025 notes at the time of such 2025 note repurchases. Five9 also expects that holders of the 2025 notes that sell their 2025 notes to Five9 may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to Five9's common stock and/or purchase or sell shares of Five9's common stock in the market to hedge their exposure in connection with these transactions. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Five9's common stock or the notes. These activities could affect the market price of Five9's common stock concurrently with the pricing of the notes, and could also result in higher effective conversion prices for the notes. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Five9 expects to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to Five9's common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Five9 is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the capped call transactions will be determined upon pricing of the notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Five9 expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. Five9 expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will purchase shares of Five9's common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Five9's common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Five9's common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Five9 expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Five9's common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of Five9's common stock or other securities of Five9 in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so (x) during any observation period related to a conversion of notes and (y) following any repurchase of notes by Five9 if it elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). These activities could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Five9's common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs following conversion or during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2025 notes, Five9 entered into capped call transactions (the ""existing capped call transactions"") with certain financial institutions (the ""existing option counterparties""). If Five9 repurchases any of the 2025 notes, it expects to enter into agreements with the existing option counterparties to terminate a portion of the existing capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the amount of 2025 notes purchased. In connection with the termination of any of these transactions, Five9 expects the existing option counterparties or their respective affiliates to sell shares of Five9's common stock and/or unwind various derivatives to unwind their hedge in connection with those transactions. This activity could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of Five9's common stock at that time and it could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market value of the notes. In connection with the termination of the existing option transactions, Five9 will receive payments in amounts that depend in part on the market price of Five9's common stock over a valuation period following the pricing of the notes. The notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful."
2024-02-26 16:12:29	IJBN	Progress Software Announces Proposed $350M Convertible Senior Notes Offering	"Progress Software Corporation (NASDAQ: IJBN ) (""Progress"") today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the ""Notes""), to be sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). Progress also expects to grant to the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $52.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the Notes are issued, solely to cover overallotments. The Notes will be Progress' senior unsecured obligations. The Notes will mature on March 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Progress will satisfy its conversion obligations by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder. The interest rate, the initial conversion rate and the other terms of the Notes will be determined upon pricing of the offering. Progress intends to use the net proceeds from the offering (i) to repay amounts outstanding under its term loan credit facility, (ii) to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below, (iii) to repurchase shares of its common stock in an amount up to $25 million, pursuant to its existing share repurchase program concurrently with the pricing of the offering in privately negotiated transactions effected through one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and (iv) for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of other indebtedness. In connection with the pricing of the Notes, Progress expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties""). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, then Progress expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Progress' common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Progress is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions and the premium payable will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Progress' common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Progress' common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Progress' common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Progress' common stock and/or purchasing or selling Progress' common stock or other securities issued by Progress in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and (x) are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, following any redemption of the Notes by Progress or following any repurchase of the Notes by Progress in connection with any fundamental change and (y) are likely to do so following any repurchase of the Notes by Progress other than in connection with any such redemption or any such fundamental change if Progress elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Progress' common stock or the Notes, which could affect a Noteholder's ability to convert the Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes, it could affect the number of shares of Progress' common stock and value of the consideration that a Noteholder will receive upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, if any such capped call transaction fails to become effective, whether or not the offering of the Notes is completed, the option counterparty party thereto may unwind its hedge positions with respect to Progress' common stock, which could adversely affect the value of Progress' common stock and, if the Notes have been issued, the value of the Notes. The Notes will be offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes and any shares of Progress' common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities law, and the Notes and any such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. persons absent registration under, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

Announces Pricing Of $1.5M Underwritten Public Offering Of Common Stock At A Price Of $0.30/Share Together With Investor Commitment For Additional $1M	"NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: XPUY ), (""NRx Pharmaceuticals"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the pricing of its underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) at a public offering price of $0.30 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1,500,000 million, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) at the public offering price per share, less the underwriting discounts to cover over-allotments, if any. The offering is expected to close on February 28, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. EF Hutton LLC is acting as the sole book-runner for the offering. In parallel, the company has received a commitment from an existing investor to invest $1,000,000 on the same terms, to be concluded separately. NRx Pharmaceuticals intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company additionally plans to use the net proceeds from the offering to service current debt obligations, rather than conveying stock for that purpose. ""Investors have asked management to provide context for this transaction and other recent events,"" said Jonathan Javitt, the Company's Chairman. ""Over the past two weeks, management has announced financing transactions that in aggregate create $7.5 million in working capital while incurring approximately 10% dilution to current shareholders. On a mathematical basis, that is highly accretive to current shareholder value while avoiding transactions involving hedge funds and warrants that are common in today's biotechnology marketplace. Common stock transactions without warrant coverage are uncommon in today's market and we thank EF Hutton for bringing fundamental retail investors to our Company. The additional capital extends the Company's runway well past the current clinical trial readouts and creates a solid platform for the launch of HOPE Therapeutics. Moreover, the capital provides the company with resources to service its current debt obligations in cash rather than paying in stock which has in the past created selling pressure on the Company's securities. We look forward to sharing the upcoming data readouts with investors, developing the NRX-101 registration program with Alvogen, and focusing on the execution of our launch of HOPE Therapeutics. Given recent developments disclosed in yesterday's presentation, we anticipate that HOPE will generate its first revenue from sales by the end of Q2 2024."""

2024-02-28 11:01:20	KVAW	FDA Grants Review Date For Applied Therapeutics' First Commercial Product For Rare Metabolic Disorder	Applied Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: KVAW ) shares are trading higher on Wednesday after the FDA accepted the filing of the New Drug Application (NDA) for govorestat (AT-007) for Classic Galactosemia . The NDA was granted Priority Review status, and the FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Free Act (PDUFA) target action date of August 28, 2024. The FDA also noted that it plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. Govorestat was previously granted Pediatric Rare Disease designation and will qualify for a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) upon approval. If approved, govorestat would be the first medication indicated for the treatment of Galactosemia and would be Applied Therapeutics' first commercial product. The company has also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for govorestat for Classic Galactosemia to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which was validated in December 2023 and is under review by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The company expects a decision by the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2024. Galactosemia is a rare genetic metabolic disease resulting in an inability to metabolize the simple sugar galactose. When not metabolized properly, galactose is converted to the toxic metabolite, galactitol, which causes neurological complications, including deficiencies in speech, cognition, behavior, and motor skills, and also results in juvenile cataracts and ovarian insufficiency (in women). Concurrently, Applied Therapeutics announced a private placement of $100 million with a sale of 12.3 million shares and 2 million pre-funded warrants at $6.999 . The company will use the net proceeds to fund govorestat (AT-007) commercial activities, develop other pipeline candidates, and work capital for general corporate purposes. The capital raised in the Private Placement and current cash and potential milestones expected from its Advanz European licensing partnership are expected to fund the business into 2026. Earlier this month, Applied Therapeutics released interim 12-month results from the ongoing Phase 3 INSPIRE trial of once-daily oral govorestat (AT-007) in 56 patients aged 16-55 with SORD Deficiency. The study achieved the primary and several key secondary endpoints . Price Action: KVAW shares are up 36.20% at $7.60 on the last check Wednesday.

Tuesday, Regulus Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ZKBT ) released topline results from the second cohort of patients in its Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study of RGLS8429 for Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) . The study evaluates RGLS8429 treatment across three different weight-based dose levels, including measuring changes in urinary polycystins 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2), height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV), cyst architecture, and overall kidney function . PC1 and PC2 are the protein products of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes and have been shown to correlate with disease severity inversely. RGLS8429 was well tolerated, with no safety findings of concern. Clear evidence of a mechanistic dose response at a 2mg/kg dose level based on urinary PC1 and PC2 polycystin levels was observed. Urinary measurements of PC1 and PC2 demonstrated greater biological activity of RGLS8429 at 2mg/kg compared to 1mg/kg and placebo, which was most evident after three months of dosing. Exploratory results of imaging-based biomarkers were encouraging, with three patients with the highest increases in PC1 and PC2 having reductions in htTKV >4%, with corresponding reductions in total kidney cyst volume (TKCV). The third cohort is being dosed at 3mg/kg of RGLS8429 or placebo every other week for three months. Data readout is anticipated in mid-2024. The company recently added a fourth cohort for an open-label fixed dose of 300mg of RGLS8429 dosed every other week for three months. Screening is expected to start in the second quarter of 2024. Concurrently, Regulus Therapeutics announced an oversubscribed $100 million equity private placement . Under the securities purchase agreement, the investors have agreed to purchase shares at $1.60 per share. Certain investors have also agreed to purchase, in lieu of common shares, shares of newly designated, non-voting Class A-6 convertible preferred stock at a purchase price of $160.00 per share.

Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle co-founder and CEO, commented: &quot;We are pleased to secure an additional $75 million investment from Glencore, following Glencore's June 2022 investment, to improve our liquidity position while we continue our ongoing comprehensive review process. This financing enhances Li-Cycle and Glencore's existing long-term, strategic partnership and represents an interim step in our funding strategy to support Li-Cycle's future plans. We also continue to work closely with the U.S. Department of Energy on the conditional commitment for a loan of up to $375 million.&quot; Tim Johnston, Li-Cycle co-founder and Executive Chairman, commented: &quot;As part of our previously announced comprehensive review, Li-Cycle is continuing to review our global recycling network. We are also reviewing our go-forward strategy for the paused Rochester Hub, including analyzing potential end-product mix options and construction strategy. We believe the demand for critical battery materials continues to accelerate and Li-Cycle continues to work to position itself as a future leader in the production of critical battery materials through our sustainable, safe, and patented recycling technology.&quot; Kunal Sinha, Global Head of Recycling for Glencore, and Non-Executive Director of Li-Cycle's Board of Directors, commented: &quot;Glencore is committed to bringing scalable and sustainable circularity into the supply chain of battery materials. Our original investment in Li-Cycle, alongside key commercial agreements, formed part of this strategy. Today, we are pleased to further support Li-Cycle through this additional $75 million investment so both Li-Cycle and Glencore can continue to build the battery circularity platform of choice for our customers.&quot; Following the announcement by the Company in October 2023 in respect of the Rochester Hub, the Company formed a Special Committee (the &quot;SC&quot;) composed solely of independent and disinterested members of the Board (and which excluded Glencore's Board representative). The SC engaged Moelis & Company LLC, a leading global investment bank (&quot;Moelis&quot;), as its financial advisor and placement agent. The SC, with the assistance of Moelis, conducted a robust process to review and evaluate potential financial and strategic alternatives available to the Company. After a careful review and assessment of the alternatives identified by the SC through this process, the Company entered into the agreement with Glencore. Li-Cycle management expects to provide its full-year 2023 financial and operating results on or before March 15, 2024 as part of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Long-Term Global Partnership As previously announced, Glencore has designated Li-Cycle as one of its preferred recycling partners, and Li-Cycle and Glencore entered into a strategic commercial partnership aimed to create an integrated platform to supply a global customer base with both primary and recycled critical battery materials. As part of the partnership, Glencore previously made a $200 million investment in Li-Cycle in June 2022 through the purchase of a convertible note (the &quot;Existing Note&quot;). Glencore is a battery feedstock partner for Li-Cycle's Spoke facilities, as well as a future supplier of both black mass and key reagents for Li-Cycle's future Hub facilities.

The Warrants have been previously adjusted following past issuances of Company securities. Currently, there are 5,596,232 Warrants exercisable at an exercise price of $1.765.

2024-03-18 07:56:24	USL	Fisker Faces Funding Challenges: Seeks $166.67M in Convertible Notes Amid Going Concern Doubts	On March 18, 2024, (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fisker&rdquo;) entered into a financing commitment and term sheet (the &ldquo;Commitment&rdquo;) with an investor (the &ldquo;Investor&rdquo;) providing for the sale of up to $166.67 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes (the &ldquo;2024 Notes&rdquo;). The 2024 Notes will have a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of up to $150 million (the &ldquo;Investment Amount&rdquo;). The 2024 Notes will be sold pursuant to a definitive securities purchase agreement (the &ldquo;SPA&rdquo;) and issued in four tranches, with the first tranche (the &ldquo;First Tranche&rdquo;) in an investment amount equal to $35 million (subject to the Company&rsquo;s projected cash balance and needs) and the remaining three tranches (each, an &ldquo;Additional Draw&rdquo;) in equal amounts up to the Investment Amount. The Company expects to enter into the SPA (such date, the &ldquo;SPA Signing Date&rdquo;) subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, and issue the First Tranche as soon as practicable thereafter, subject to the applicable closing conditions described below. All amounts due under the 2024 Notes will be convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the Investor&rsquo;s option, into shares of the Company&rsquo;s Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the &ldquo;Class A Common Stock&rdquo;), at the then-applicable Conversion Price (as defined below), plus all accrued and unpaid interest and Undrawn Investment Fees (as defined below) with respect to such portion of such principal amount of Notes, subject to applicable securities laws and exchange limitations. The 2024 Notes will mature upon the earlier of (i) three (3) months from the date of issuance of the First Tranche, (ii) the effective date of a registration statement for the primary sale of registered securities by the Company, or (iii) July 31, 2024 (such date, the &ldquo;Maturity Date&rdquo;). In the event any holder of the Notes elects to convert the Notes and the conversion is suspended due to the Beneficial Ownership Cap (as defined below), then the Notes shall remain outstanding until the Notes can be converted or such holder elects to receive the applicable remaining payment in cash. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We used $906.3 million in cash in operating and investing activities in 2023, and our cash balance reduced from $736.5 million at December 31, 2022 to $325.5 million at December 31, 2023 (all numbers are preliminary and unaudited as of the date hereof). Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was further reduced to $120.9 million as of March 15, 2024, reflecting significant payments to certain suppliers (numbers are preliminary and unaudited as of the date hereof). We expect to require additional cash in 2024 for debt service and investment needs, and our ability to generate cash from operating activities will depend on our ability to transition to a dealer model and sell vehicles. Accordingly, we have concluded there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt or equity financings, enter into a strategic partnership with an OEM, and generate cash from the sale of vehicles. We need significant additional funding in the near term to execute our business plan and to continue our operations. We continue to seek and evaluate opportunities to raise additional funds through the issuance of our securities, through an arrangement with a potential strategic partner, and from the sale of vehicles. If capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to further curtail our operations. Moreover, we may not be able to satisfy our debt service obligations and could need to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need to continue our operations.

Constellation will use proceeds from the $900 million, 30-year term offering for investments such as maintenance, expansion and life extensions of its clean, reliable nuclear power generation that reduce or avoid carbon emissions or provide other environmental benefits. A green bond is a financial instrument that is issued specifically to finance projects or activities that deliver positive environmental or climate impacts. It allows investors to actively support investments that promote sustainability and help address environmental challenges. &quot;Elected officials on both sides of the aisle, climate and sustainability advocates and the general public are increasingly recognizing the value nuclear energy delivers, not only for its unmatched 24/7 reliability, but for its positive environmental impact as a clean energy resource. The strong market response shows the investment community agrees nuclear energy is a unique clean-energy technology that is going to play a critical role for decades to come and is a safe, long-term investment,&quot; said Dan Eggers, executive vice president and CFO, Constellation. &quot;With the nation's first-ever corporate nuclear green bond issuance as part of our long-term financing mix, Constellation and the market have again confirmed: Nuclear investments are long-term sustainability investments.&quot; The nuclear green bond offering was based on a new green financing framework that Constellation developed to enable the company to issue green financial instruments. Proceeds from the issuance can be used to finance green projects such as nuclear uprates, which increase production of clean, carbon-free energy at Constellation's clean energy centers, technologies to produce clean hydrogen, energy storage systems, wind repowering and carbon-free energy solutions for Constellation's commercial customers. Cr&eacute;dit Agricole CIB, the corporate and investment banking arm of Cr&eacute;dit Agricole Group, served as Green Structuring agent in Constellation's nuclear green bond offering. &quot;Our bank is pleased to have supported Constellation on the first-ever U.S. corporate green bond with proceeds allocated towards nuclear energy. This groundbreaking transaction is a testament to Constellation's ambitious sustainability efforts, and such leadership in the sustainable finance capital markets will undoubtedly serve as an inspiration for future global nuclear focused green bond issuances,&quot; said Romina Reversi, Head of Sustainable Investment Banking for the Americas at Cr&eacute;dit Agricole CIB. The firm Sustainalytics has verified the environmental benefits of Constellation's framework and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles, 2021 issued by the International Capital Markets Association and Green Loan Principles, 2023 by the Loan Market Association. These voluntary guidelines for issuing or borrowing green financing instruments support a green label for Constellation's bond issuance. Constellation's nuclear green bond issuance is the latest validation of its leadership in responsible business practices, coming on the heels of the company's ninth-place ranking on Barron's list of the 100 most sustainable U.S. companies and being named one of America's most just companies by JUST Capital and CNBC.

What Happened: ShiftPixy has announced the pricing of its &#8220;reasonable best efforts&#8221; offering of 1,176,470 units. The units will be offered for $4.25 per unit and priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one common warrant, which is immediately exercisable at a price of $4.25 per share and has a term of five years. The human capital management platform company said it anticipates gross proceeds of $5 million. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The offering is expected to close on or about March 21. See Also: Why National CineMedia Shares Are Surging Today Is OGSK A Good Stock To Buy? An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages &#8211; like ShiftPixy 's page for example &#8211; there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter. These are known as capital allocation programs. ShiftPixy does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company. For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 7.47%, you'll need to buy a share of NewtekOne by March 28, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.19 on April 15, 2024. Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on ShiftPixy will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand. OGSK Price Action: ShiftPixy shares were down 18.8% at $5.52 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro . Photo: Pexels from Pixabay.

The registration statement, which covered shares issuable upon the exercise of a warrant that was declared as a dividend, is no longer needed because those shares may now be issued under an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Company confirms that no shares have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement. Ellery Roberts, CEO of 1847 stated, ""It is important to make sure our shareholders understand that we are not actively raising capital, nor are we intending to issue shares this time. In our view, leaving an open registration statement conveys the wrong message to shareholders."" Mr. Roberts continued, ""We do not believe our current market capitalization accurately reflects the true value of our operating company portfolio, or the incremental value of the Company's public listing. We've made significant strides in building value within our portfolio, including the recent announcements regarding: ICU Eyewear: We recently expanded our relationship with a national retail partner, expanding into an additional 300 locations retail locations across the US. As a result, our growth outlook for this business is well above our industry peer group for the foreseeable future. We also made significant progress optimizing our manufacturing capabilities and expect to improve margins by upwards of 12% in 2024. These two developments alone are expected to dramatically improve our cash flows in ICU Eyewear in 2024 and beyond. Signature Home Craft: We recently engaged Spartan Capital to help evaluate our ability to spin off our rebranded cabinet business into its own independently listed company. With the existing scale and profitability profile, we believe our cabinet operations have the growth potential to create lasting shareholder value as a standalone business. We view this as a top priority for execution in 2024. Wolo Manufacturing: We recently executed a working capital revolving line of credit facility for $750,000 to support the operations of Wolo. With this capital we are quickly turning our focus to driving additional revenue growth using non-dilutive capital to enhance shareholder value. Roberts continued, ""We believe that as the public markets better appreciates the impact of our recent initiatives, we will see these actions reflected in a higher valuation for 1847 Holdings shareholders. We have enjoyed a strong track record opportunistically acquiring small companies, strengthening their operations, and unlocking shareholder value through either a sale or GIP at higher valuations."" ""We expect to achieve a number of milestones in the coming months that will demonstrate our continued ability to execute this growth strategy. This success has attracted attention from industry leaders resulting in unsolicited Indications of Interest for more than one of our subsidiaries,"" concluded Mr. Roberts."

2024-03-28 09:27:22	ZUS	ZUS Entertainment Stock Is Tumbling Thursday: What's Going On?	ZUS Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: ZUS ) shares are trading lower Thursday after the company announced an at-the-market offering program . What Happened: In a new regulatory filing, ZUS said it entered into an equity distribution agreement to sell up to $250 million of its common stock from time to time in an at-the-market offering. ZUS intends to use the net proceeds to bolster liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase its existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. &#8220;Among other reasons, the offering is being conducted to enhance the Company's liquidity in light of the low first quarter box office, resulting in part as previously disclosed from the Writers Guild of America strike and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike that occurred during 2023, increased seasonal working capital requirements, and the resulting cash burn the Company has experienced,&#8221; the company said in the filing. ZUS is not obligated to sell any stock under the equity distribution agreement and may at any time suspend offers under the agreement. Check This Out: Jim Cramer Says GameStop Is Arguably The Worst Company In America ZUS Stock Prediction 2024 Equity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory. Some investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at ZUS, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For ZUS, the 200-day moving average sits at $16.16, according to Benzinga Pro , which is above the current price of $3.85. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here. Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.

This Private Placement supersedes and replaces the $150 million purchase, offering and sale of Blue Ridge common stock that was announced on December 22, 2023 (the ""Previous Transaction""), for which all closing conditions were not satisfied. Blue Ridge intends to use the capital to propel its near-term strategic initiatives, which include repositioning business lines, supporting organic growth, and further enhancing the core community bank's capital levels, including complying with the capital ratios set forth in the previously disclosed Consent Order issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to Blue Ridge Bank. ""Although we believe we had nearly satisfied the appropriate closing conditions of the Previous Transaction, we received a shareholder inquiry that has raised questions about how votes were tabulated by an outside party on the articles amendment proposal at the shareholders meeting that made it difficult to move forward in a timely fashion, so we felt the best path was to adjust the offering structure,"" said President and CEO, G. William ""Billy"" Beale. ""We appreciate the commitment of the investors from the Previous Transaction to Blue Ridge as this continues to represent a significant step for our Virginia-based community bank to build a stronger platform for growth and shareholder value."""

2024-04-05 12:57:57	GPMV	Protara Therapeutics Shares Interim Data From Bladder Cancer Study, Raises $45M Via Equity	Friday, Protara Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: GPMV ) shared data from three-month evaluable carcinoma in situ (CIS) patients treated across GPMV-002 program, the company's investigational cell-based therapy, in high-risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), including Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-Unresponsive, BCG-Experienced and BCG-Naïve patient populations . Data were derived from three-month evaluable NMIBC patients with CIS pooled across the company's ADVANCED-1 Phase 1a, Phase 1b-expansion and ADVANCED-2 Phase 2 trials. The overall three-month complete response (CR) rate before reinduction for 16 evaluable patients treated across the three trials with varying BCG status was 38% (6/16), with a CR rate of 63% (5/8) in CIS-only patients and 13% (1/8) in patients with CIS +Ta/T1. The company believes that reinduction and planned enhancements to dosing and administration will lead to an increased CR rate at six months in patients who did not achieve a CR at three months, as reinduction with other immune agents in NMIBC patients with CIS has demonstrated a 30%-50% salvage rate. The company plans to explore additional dosing cohorts. Most reported adverse events were Grades 1 and 2 across all dose levels and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Enrollment continues in the ADVANCED-2 Phase 2 trial of GPMV-002 in patients with high-grade NMIBC with BCG-Unresponsive CIS and BCG-Naïve CIS. The ADVANCED-2 trial design incorporates reinduction and maintenance dosing. The company expects to share preliminary results from a pre-planned risk-benefit analysis of the ADVANCED-2 trial in ten patients, who are six-month evaluable in the second half of 2024. Concurrently, Protara Therapeutics reached alignment with the FDA on a registrational path forward for intravenous (IV) Choline Chloride . The company had previously been pursuing an indication in intestinal failure-associated liver disease and, following FDA feedback, will now pursue a broader indication in patients on parenteral nutrition (PN) who are or may become unable to synthesize choline from oral or enteral nutrition sources. The company expects to start a registrational trial to support FDA approval of IV Choline Chloride for PN patients in the first half of 2025. Protara Therapeutics also announced a private placement of 9.14 million shares, pre-funded warrants to purchase 1.7 million, along with warrants to purchase 10.8 million shares . Each Share, along with its attached Common Warrant, has a purchase price of $4.15, and each Pre-Funded Warrant, along with its attached Common Warrant, has a purchase price of $4.149. Gross proceeds from the private placement are expected to be approximately $45 million. Price Action: GPMV shares are down 5.94% at $3.781 on the last check Friday. Photo via Shutterstock

In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages &#8211; like SoundHound AI 's page for example &#8211; there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter. These are known as capital allocation programs. SoundHound AI does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company. Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on SoundHound AI will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand.

2024-04-15 09:18:37	KMN	Trump Media & Technology Group Stock Is Tumbling Monday: What's Going On?	Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ: KMN ) shares are trading lower Monday after the company filed a prospectus related to the issuance of millions of shares of additional stock. What To Know: Former President Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group, which is behind the Truth Social platform, has filed for the potential issuance of up to 21.49 million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants related to Digital World. Trump is the majority shareholder in the company. The filing also provides for the offer and sale of up to 146.1 million shares of common stock from time to time by certain selling stockholders. The news comes after the company released financial information from 2023 and warned of continuing operating losses earlier this month. Trump Media reported revenue of $4.13 million for full-year 2023, and a net loss of $58.19 million for the year. The company ended the year with just $2.6 million in cash, down from $9.8 million at the end of 2022, and warned that it expects losses to continue in 2024. The financial disclosure came a week after the company successfully completed its business combination with Digital World and began trading on the Nasdaq .

For example, in Trump Media & Technology's case, it is in the Communication Services sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.

"Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (NYSE: JLWD ), a leading solutions provider for the education industry, today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the adoption of a short-term stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 10% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions. Each right will entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $5.00. If a person or group acquires 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock, each right will entitle its holder (other than such person or members of such group) to purchase for $5.00, a number of Company common shares having a market value of twice such price. In addition, at any time after a person or group acquires 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock, the Company's Board of Directors may exchange one share of the Company's common stock for each outstanding right (other than rights owned by such person or group, which would have become void). Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 10% of the Company's common stock, the rights are redeemable for one cent per right at the option of the Board of Directors. Certain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions—whether or not such interests are considered to constitute beneficial ownership of the underlying common stock for reporting purposes under Regulation 13D of the Securities Exchange Act—are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of shares of the Company's common stock equivalent to the economic exposure created by the derivative position, to the extent actual shares of the Company's stock are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. The dividend distribution will be made on April 29, 2024, payable to stockholders on that date and is not taxable to stockholders.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. In the case of Inovio, which is trading at $8.38 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 11.93 shares of stock. If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

2024-04-16 13:32:45	MNVX	Cullinan Shifts Focus From Oncology To Autoimmune Disorders, Raises $280M Via Equity	Cullinan Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: MNVX ), formerly Cullinan Oncology Inc, announced its plans to expand into autoimmune diseases and intends to pursue the development of CLN-978 in autoimmune diseases, with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as a first indication . In SLE, the immune system of the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The company believes that CLN-978 has the potential to be a first-in-class, off-the-shelf, disease-modifying treatment in autoimmune diseases with a differentiated safety profile​. The company plans to submit an investigational new drug application to study CLN-978 in patients with SLE in the third quarter of 2024 and is also planning for future development in other autoimmune diseases. Cullinan Therapeutics has discontinued enrollment in its B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) study to focus ongoing development on autoimmune indications. Recent data demonstrated the potential of CD19-directed CAR F therapies in 15 patients with autoimmune diseases. The company shared initial clinical observations from its Phase 1 dose escalation trial of CLN-978 in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical observations from three patients treated in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of patients with B-NHL show that CLN-978 was clinically active at the initial starting dose of 30 μg administered subcutaneously once weekly. Two of the three patients experienced objective clinical benefit, including one who experienced a complete response. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome occurred in two patients, and no patients experienced immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. The company also announced a $280 million private placement . The proceeds from the private placement, combined with current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and interest receivable, are expected to fund Cullinan's current operating plan into 2028. Monday, William Blair initiated coverage on Cullinan with an Outperform rating and a $35-per-share fair value based on the potential of the company's diversified pipeline of assets, including CLN-619 in endometrial cancer, CLN-978 in B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. The analyst says the company's strategy, which is flexible across different treatment methods and emphasizes developing new drugs and licensing existing ones, has led to a diverse portfolio of unique assets. This approach consistently offers chances for significant value growth based on clinical results. The success of zipalertinib and CLN-619 so far demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategy. With many projects, the company can focus on advancing programs that show promise as standalone treatments. Price Action: MNVX shares are up 3.75% at $17.70 on the last check Tuesday.

2024-05-07 15:40:23	QTYX	Nano-Cap Eledon Pharmaceuticals' Investigational Drug Shows Safety In Early Organ Transplant Study, Analyst Boosts Forecast On Increased Confidence	Tuesday, Eledon Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: QTYX ) announced that the first participant in an investigator-led clinical trial has received an islet cell transplant and is being treated with tegoprubart for the prevention of pancreatic islet cell transplant rejection in type 1 diabetes patients . The company also reported updated data from its ongoing Phase 1b trial as of April 2024 from 13 participants, demonstrating that tegoprubart is generally safe and well-tolerated and supports tegoprubart's potential to protect organ function in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Aggregate mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) – a measure of kidney function – measured above 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at all reported time points after day 30. Two subjects completed 12 months on therapy post-transplant and both demonstrated mean eGFRs above 90 mL/min/1.73m2 at one year. To date, three subjects discontinued the study because of hair loss and fatigue, viral infection, and rejection, respectively. There have been no cases of graft loss or death. Eledon is currently conducting a Phase 1b trial, the Phase 2 BESTOW trial, and a Long-Term Safety and Efficacy extension study to evaluate tegoprubart for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients. Concurrently, Eledon Pharmaceuticals announced a private placement of approximately $50 million, offering 13.1 million shares at $2.37 per share and pre-funded warrants at $2.369 per underlying share, which are exercisable to purchase 7.99 million shares . HC Wainwright suggests that islet cell transplantation could be a promising way to reverse type 1 diabetes by restoring metabolic control without relying on insulin injections. The analyst highlights tegopruibart's potential to decrease or replace intensive anti-rejection drugs without causing side effects. HC Wainwright reiterates the Buy rating, and with increased confidence in tegoprubart's probability of advancement into a pivotal study, it has raised the price target from $13 to $16 . The analyst continues to look for the potential signing of a licensing collaboration agreement, including an upfront payment worth up to $100 million, for further development and commercialization of tegoprubart around the 2025 timeframe as a future catalyst. Price Action: QTYX shares are down 9.63% at $2.21 at last check Tuesday.

2024-05-17 09:44:38	ACI	Why Is GameStop Stock Crashing Premarket After Early Gains? (CORRECTED)	Editor's Note: The size of the offering has been corrected to 45 million shares. Shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE: ACI ) plunged hard in premarket trading, signaling that the stock could be headed for a third straight session of losses. The video game retailer released preliminary first-quarter results, anticipating revenue between $0.872 billion and $0.892 billion. This represents a significant decline from the prior year's quarter of $1.237 billion. Additionally, GameStop expects a loss of $27 million to $37 million, narrower than the $50.5 million loss reported a year ago. Notably, the revenue estimate falls short of analyst consensus expectations of $1.05 billion. GameStop also anticipates a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to the year-ago period, estimating this range to be between $1.073 billion and $1.093 billion, dropping from $1.310 billion. Separately, GameStop filed a prospectus with the SEC for an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering, allowing them to sell up to 45 million common shares. The company intends to utilize the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, potentially including acquisitions and investments. The company also said in the prospectus it would offer preferred Stock, depository shares, warrants, stock purchase warrants, units, and subscription rights. This announcement shouldn't come as a surprise for those following GameStop closely. Market analysts anticipated such a move after the stock experienced a surge earlier this week, likely fueled by a post from Keith Gill (better known as &#8220;Roaring Kitty&#8221;), a central figure in the original meme stock frenzy of early 2021. In premarket trading, the stock fell 22.30% to $21.50, according to Benzinga Pro data. See Also: Best Meme Stocks Right Now

Related Link: GameStop Shares Fall On Offering: 'One Shouldn't Buy Stocks Just Because They Are Going Up,' Fund Manager Says Why It's Important : GameStop shares fell when they announced the planned at-the-market offering and announced preliminary first-quarter financial results. The increase in the stock price after hours on Friday could indicate that investors perceive the dilution as complete and believe the shares are undervalued at their current sale price. The return and subsequent exit of Roaring Kitty , a key figure in the GameStop short squeeze saga of 2021, has made shares of the video game company highly volatile. ACI Price Action: GameStop shares are up 16% to $22.14 in after-hours trading Friday after closing at $19.00. Shares have traded between $9.95 and $64.83 over the last 52 weeks.

The company filed for a mixed shelf offering on Friday before being named a top pick by Morgan Stanley this week . What To Know: After the market close on Friday, DraftKings filed a prospectus supplement for the proposed sale of up to 7.5 million shares of its Class A common stock by selling stockholders. All of the shares being offered would be sold by the selling stockholders for their respective accounts. DraftKings will not receive any of the proceeds from the sales by the selling stockholders. DraftKings shares traded lower following the filing, but the stock is bouncing back in early trading Monday. The upward momentum appears to be due to reports indicating DraftKings was added to Morgan Stanley's Top Picks list on Monday. Several reports suggest Morgan Stanley argued in a new note to clients that recent tax increase concerns could be overdone. The firm reportedly sees earnings upside on the horizon. Morgan Stanley reiterated DraftKings with an Overweight rating and a price target of $51.

Related News: Clover Health's $1 Million Insider Buy: What's Going On With The Stock? Is YIMO A Good Stock To Buy? An investor can make a few decisions when deciding whether a stock is a good buy. In addition to valuation metrics and price action which you can find on Benzinga's quote pages — like Birkenstock Holding 's page, for example — there are factors like whether or not a company pays a dividend or buys a large portion of its stock each quarter. These are known as capital allocation programs. Birkenstock Holding does not pay a dividend, but obviously has a few ways it can return value to shareholders. Feel free to search Benzinga's dividend calendar for the next company that is due to pay a dividend and determine what kind of yield you can earn for holding a share of the company. For example, if you're looking to earn an annualized return of 19.77%, you'll need to buy a share of Dividend Growth Split by June 28, 2024. Once done, you can expect to receive a nominal payout of $0.10 on July 15, 2024. Buyback programs are obviously different and highly variable. A company can approve a buyback program and purchase shares as it sees fit over the course of time in which the buyback was authorized. Looking through the latest news on Birkenstock Holding will often yield whether or not the company has approved a buyback program recently. Buyback programs usually serve as a support for share prices, serving as a backstop for demand. YIMO Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro , Birkenstock shares ended Monday's regular session 2.75% lower at $59.78 and are down another 3.90% after-hours at $57.45 at the time of publication.

Thursday, Elicio Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: LMCF ) released new preliminary data from the ongoing AMPLIFY-7P Phase 1a study of its off-the-shelf investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate, ELI-002 7P . The preliminary data showed patients receiving ELI-002 7P at the Phase 2 dose of 4.9mg AMP-peptide were yet to reach the median disease-free survival (DFS) endpoint as of the May 24, 2024 data cutoff date. The AMPLIFY-7P study is evaluating the 7-peptide formulation ELI-002 7P in patients with mKRAS-driven solid tumors following standard locoregional treatment. Data were based on May 24, 2024, data cutoff date of 14 patients with minimal residual disease who enrolled in the Phase 1 cohort of the AMPLIFY-7P study, with a median follow-up for the DFS endpoint of 29.1 weeks: The median DFS has not yet been reached (n=14). The median disease-free survival (mDFS) has not been reached in patients receiving the 4.9mg AMP-peptide dose (n=8) vs. 12.6 weeks for patients receiving the 1.4mg AMP-peptide dose (n=6). Patients achieving a reduction in their tumor biomarker levels had no progression events, compared to an mDFS of 11.0 weeks for patients whose tumor biomarker did not respond to ELI-002 7P. Patients with an above-median F-cell response to ELI-002 have had no progression events. The company expects to share additional clinical data updates from the AMPLIFY Phase 1 trials later in 2024 and the randomized Phase 2 interim analysis in the first quarter of 2025. ELI-002 2P (2-peptide formulation) is currently being studied in an ongoing Phase 1 (AMPLIFY-201) trial in patients with high relapse risk mKRAS-driven solid tumors following surgery and chemotherapy.

The investment values XTI at $275 million post-money and aims to accelerate the development of its innovative TriFan aircraft.

XTI CEO Scott Pomeroy said, &#8220;Assuming the completion of the proposed investment, we believe the additional capital will help accelerate the development of the TriFan through several major milestones including completion of the updated preliminary design review along with launching the critical design review phase in preparation for the assembly of XTI's Test Aircraft No. 1.&#8221; The $275 million valuation aligns with a fairness opinion provided prior to XTI's merger with Inpixon. This valuation reflects the progress made since the last capital raise based on a $100 million valuation. Anindya Chakraborty highlighted the TriFan's potential for widespread adoption across emerging aviation markets, including India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The VTOL aircraft is poised to serve diverse applications such as healthcare, emergency services, para-military operations, corporate mobility, and luxury travel.

(NASDAQ: LJRU ) released topline results from the Phase 2 SPRING trial assessing its monoclonal antibody, CM-101, in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) . Treatment with CM-101 achieved its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability. It demonstrated anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cholestatic effects across various disease-related secondary efficacy endpoints, including statistically significant improvement in liver stiffness. CM-101 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and was generally well-tolerated over the 15-week treatment period. It also exhibited favorable and dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profiles. Adverse events, which most commonly included fatigue, headache, and pruritis, were generally mild/moderate and distributed similarly between the placebo and CM-101-treated dosing arms. Both doses of CM-101 improved liver stiffness relative to placebo at Week 15, with a statistically significant improvement achieved in patients with moderate/advanced disease. Pruritis (itch) total scores relative to placebo improved in CM-101-treated patients, who demonstrated decreased pruritis scores compared to placebo starting as soon as six weeks after their first dose. CM-101-treated patients experienced decreased pruritis scores across all time points compared to placebo, and the decrease reached statistical significance in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg dose at Week 15. All liver function tests improved in CM-101-treated patients relative to placebo at Week 15. Chemomab is preparing for an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the SPRING trial results and the design of a proposed Phase 3 PSC trial for accelerated approval. The company anticipates completing these discussions by the end of the year and receiving official written feedback from the FDA in the first quarter of 2025. An Open-Label Extension portion of the SPRING trial, which allows patients to receive CM-101 for an additional 33 weeks, is ongoing. Topline treatment results from this portion of the study, including patients with up to 48 weeks of exposure to CM-101, are on track to be reported in the first quarter of 2025. Concurrently, Chemomab Therapeutics announced a private investment in public equity of approximately $10 million via selling 4.19 million ADSs at $1.235 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3.91 ADSs at a $1.235/warrant .

At approval, Furoscix was only indicated for congestion due to fluid overload in adult patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II and Class III chronic heart failure. The new indication now includes patients with NYHA Class IV chronic heart failure, who represent the most symptomatic patients, and those with the greatest limitation on physical activity, comprising approximately 10% of all heart failure patients nationally. scPharmaceuticals also announced non-dilutive financings on Monday of up to $125 million from Perceptive Advisors. Proceeds from the transactions will be used to repay existing debt and fund activities related to the ongoing commercialization of Furoscix . scPharmaceuticals received $75 million through a combination of debt and royalty financings at close, with access to an additional $50 million. The term loan refinances existing debt principal, lowers coupon, extends the interest-only period for four additional years, and lowers the minimum cash requirement to $5 million. Monday, scPharmaceuticals also released topline results from the pharmacokinetic (PK) study of SCP-111, an investigational, low-volume, pH-neutral formulation of furosemide administered via an autoinjector as an alternative to the current on-body infusor used with Furoscix . The objectives of the study were to estimate the bioavailability and describe the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SCP-111 administered as a subcutaneous injection via an autoinjector compared with the equivalent dose of furosemide administered as two 40mg IV injections administered over 1-to-2 minutes, two hours apart and to describe the safety and tolerability of the SCP-111 injection. Key highlights of the topline results from the study: SCP-111 demonstrated a bioavailability of 107.3%. Participants who received SCP-111 had similar urine output, urinary sodium excretion, and urinary potassium excretion at 6, 8, and 12 hours compared to IV furosemide. Participants reported a median pain score of 0 across all time points assessed. The most common adverse events with SCP-111 were localized to the injection site, and systemic adverse events were consistent with those reported in the prescribing information for intravenous and oral furosemide. Concurrently, the company announced a proposed underwritten public offering of shares and pre-funded warrants. Additional terms were not disclosed .

The offering size was increased from the previously announced offering size of $125 million aggregate principal amount of notes as a result of strong demand on the offering. The issuance and sale of the notes is scheduled to settle on October 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Pagaya US also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $20 million principal amount of notes. Pagaya intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repay higher-cost debt facilities and reduce interest expense costs with the remainder for general corporate purposes. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Pagaya US, and will accrue interest at a rate of 6.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2025. The notes will mature on October 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or exchanged. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 2, 2029, the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders of notes only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after July 2, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders of the notes at any time regardless of these conditions. Subject to certain conditions, Pagaya US may settle exchanges of the notes by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, Class A ordinary shares of Pagaya or a combination of cash and Class A ordinary shares of Pagaya, at the election of Pagaya US. The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by Pagaya. The initial exchange rate is 71.4669 Class A ordinary shares of Pagaya per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial exchange price of approximately $13.99 per Class A ordinary share of Pagaya. The initial exchange price represents a premium of approximately 45% over the last reported sale price of $9.65 per Class A ordinary share of Pagaya on September 26, 2024. The exchange rate and exchange price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If a ""make-whole fundamental change"" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, Pagaya US will, in certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate for a specified time for holders who exchange their notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change. The notes will not be redeemable prior to October 5, 2027. The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations on partial redemptions), for cash at the option of Pagaya US at any time, and from time to time, on or after October 5, 2027 and on or before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per Class A ordinary share of Pagaya exceeds 130% of the exchange price for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If Pagaya US calls any or all notes for redemption, holders of notes called for redemption may exchange their notes during the related redemption exchange period, and any such exchange will also constitute a ""make-whole fundamental change"" with respect to the called notes so exchanged. If a ""fundamental change"" (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Pagaya US to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The offering price of the notes is 95% of the principal amount of notes. Pagaya estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $128.1 million (or approximately $146.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and Pagaya's estimated offering expenses."

2024-10-10 13:33:31	KDLF	Why Is Cancer-Focused Immatics Stock Trading Lower On Thursday?	On Thursday, Immatics N.V. (NASDAQ: KDLF ) stock is trading lower after the company commenced an underwritten public offering of $150 million . The company also announced updated Phase 1b data on ACTengine IMA203 TCR-F targeting PRAME in melanoma patients and provided an update on SUPRAME, the upcoming Phase 3 trial to evaluate IMA203 in metastatic melanoma patients . As of August 23, 2024, 28 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with IMA203 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1 to 10 billion total TCR-F cells) during the Phase 1b dose expansion part of the clinical trial. IMA203 monotherapy has maintained a favorable tolerability profile with no treatment-related Grade 5 adverse events in the safety population, even at doses up to ~10&#215;10 power 9 TCR-F cells. The data presented demonstrate a significant positive shift in median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) between melanoma patients treated during Phase 1a and patients treated in Phase 1b. In addition, approximately half of all patients in the Phase 1b trial have a deep response (>50% tumor reduction). This subgroup of patients was observed to have a median PFS of more than one year, while patients with <50% tumor reduction (including patients with tumor size increase) were still observed with a more than 2 times longer median PFS compared to patients treated in dose escalation with suboptimal doses. Translational data from patients across Phase 1a and Phase 1b indicate that IMA203 F cells rapidly engrafted in all patients after a single dose and show a persistence of more than two years. The Phase 3 trial will evaluate IMA203 targeting PRAME in 360 HLA-A&#x2A;02:01-positive patients with second-line or later unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Phase 3 trial is on track to commence in December 2024 and patient enrollment is forecasted to be completed in 2026. A pre-specified interim analysis is planned for early 2026. The company aims to submit an FDA marketing application in early 2027 for full approval. Price Action: KDLF stock is down 11.1% at $9.841 at last check Thursday.

2024-10-16 07:56:29	NV	Why Is Versus Systems Stock Rocketing Over 300% Premarket On Wednesday?	Versus Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: NV ) shares are rocketing premarket on Wednesday. The company disclosed that it has entered into two major agreements with Aspis Cyber Technologies, Inc. (ASPIS) . ASPIS is affiliated with Cronus Equity Capital Group, LLC, which holds approximately 39.5% of the company's outstanding common stock. The first is a Business Funding Agreement, which includes an investment of $2.5 million from ASPIS in Versus Systems. ASPIS has initially invested $500,000, with the remaining $2 million due by November 15, 2024. In return, Versus Systems issued an unsecured convertible promissory note for $2.5 million. The Note can be converted into units, each consisting of one common share and a warrant for half a share at an exercise price of $4.00. The company plans to seek shareholder approval at its annual meeting in December 2024. The second agreement allows ASPIS to license Versus Systems' gamification, engagement, and QR code technology for its cybersecurity solutions in sectors like government, finance, gaming, and social media. ASPIS will pay a monthly licensing fee and compensate for any technology updates or innovations. These agreements support Versus Systems' compliance plan submitted to Nasdaq on October 7, 2024, to maintain the required $2.5 million in shareholders' equity for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The company aims to exceed this minimum to ensure compliance until at least September 30, 2025. Under the agreements, if Versus Systems receives shareholder approval for the equity issuance and its redomiciling to Delaware, ASPIS could convert the Note and exercise the warrants to receive approximately 2.155 million shares of common stock and warrants for an additional 1.077 million shares at a final price of $1.16. This would give ASPIS about 45.8% of Versus Systems' outstanding common stock, not including shares from warrant exercises or conversions of accrued cash interest into units. The License Agreement establishes a monthly fee of $165,000, starting in January 2025, allowing ASPIS to use any modifications to the licensed technology for cybersecurity. Nasdaq will review the company's compliance plan, if its not accepted or compliance isn't met by February 18, 2025, delisting proceedings may begin. In such cases, Versus reserves the right to request a hearing for an additional extension. Price Action : NV shares are up 300% at $4.60 premarket at the last check Wednesday.

Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson told CNBC the move was intended to prevent the need for a &#8220;going concern&#8221; disclosure. In other words, the company's financial runway is dwindling. The CEO also said that investors should have seen the stock offering coming. ""We'd signaled that we had a cash runway to Q4 next year. As a Nasdaq company, we have to avoid a going concern. And a going concern is issued within 12 months of your financial runway,"" Rawlinson said. ""So, it should have been no surprise to anybody."" Read Next: Bank Of America CEO Cautions Fed Not To 'Go Too Fast Or Too Slow' On Interest Rate Cuts Lucid's most recent public offering of 262.44 million shares came only two months after Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund injected $1.5 billion in cash into the electric vehicle maker to extend its cash runaway through the end of 2025. Investors and Wall Street analysts were surprised by the timing and size of Lucid's offering. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan predicted a sharp decline in the share price following the company's announcement last week. ""We suspect that investors will wonder why TQJB is raising more capital just after it secured the PIF capital in August, and at currently depressed share price levels,"" Narayan reportedly wrote in an investor note. Rawlinson said the company is in a capital-intensive period as it prepares to launch its second electric vehicle, the Lucid Gravity SUV. The U.S.-based EV maker is also building a second factory in Saudi Arabia while expanding its Arizona factory and building its retail vehicle and service network. Lucid's CEO told CNBC the company now has a cash runway into 2026 and will continue to raise capital ""opportunistically."" ""This is exactly as expected. It is exactly to the playbook. It should have come as zero surprise to anyone,"" he said. ""And why did I choose this moment? Because I didn't want to string it out to the end, because I didn't have to."" Price Action: Lucid shares have fallen 28% following the announcement of the offering.

See Also: Corning Q3 Earnings Beat Expectations with 8% Core Sales Growth, Optical Communications Segment Shines How To Buy JOM Stock Besides going to a brokerage platform to purchase a share &#8211; or fractional share &#8211; of stock, you can also gain access to shares either by buying an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds the stock itself, or by allocating yourself to a strategy in your 401(k) that would seek to acquire shares in a mutual fund or other instrument. For example, in Keurig Dr Pepper's case, it is in the Consumer Staples sector. An ETF will likely hold shares in many liquid and large companies that help track that sector, allowing an investor to gain exposure to the trends within that segment.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading &#8211; either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

On Thursday, Palisade Bio Inc (NASDAQ: VGLI ) stock is trading higher with a strong session volume of 26.97 million, compared to an average volume of 107.68k as per data from Benzinga Pro . Palisade Bio priced an underwritten public offering for gross proceeds of approximately $5 million . The offering comprises 158,000 Class A Units and 3.12 million Class B Units. The price per Class A Unit is $1.525, and the price per Class B Unit is $1.5249. The Common Warrants will have an exercise price of $1.40 per share, will be exercisable at issuance, and will have a term expiring five years from issuance. The company will use the net proceeds primarily to fund the Phase 1 trial of VGLI-2108, pre-clinical studies, research and development, and working capital. Last week, Palisade Bio revealed preliminary results from its first three single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts in its ongoing Phase 1 human study for VGLI-2108 for Ulcerative Colitis . Preliminary results appear to indicate that VGLI-2108 was safe and well tolerated in the first three cohorts (n=24; 6:2 active to placebo) at 15mg, 50mg, and 150mg, with no treatment-related dose reductions, no Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAEs), no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and no treatment-related lab abnormalities in any subject. Preliminary pharmacokinetics data from the first cohorts demonstrated delayed release of the PDE4 inhibitor active suggesting VGLI-2108 is performing as designed with colonic bioactivation. Based on the findings with this preliminary safety data, the company is advancing toward its planned crossover study to evaluate the effects of food on pharmacokinetics, followed by multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts and, finally, a multiple-dose cohort of patients with Ulcerative Colitis. The company is on track to report topline data from this study in the first half of 2025. As of September 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.0 million. The company believes it has sufficient cash to fund its planned operations through the first quarter of 2025 . Price Action: VGLI stock is trading 51.5% higher at $2.12 at last check Thursday.
